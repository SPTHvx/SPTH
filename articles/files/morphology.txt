  0) Intro Words

     For more than 1.5 years I'm thinking about this topic,  and recently I saw
     that it is important  to let you know about it.  With this  text I want to
     give an answere and solution to the questions,  why antivirus-programs can
     detect even the  best hidding  techniques nowadays  (metamorphism combined
     with permutation, full target integration and polymorphical encryption).



  1) Why The Mental Driller was wrong

     In 29a#6 'The Mental Driller' has released an article called "Metamorphism
     in practice" where he wrote in the conclusion:

        Metamorphism: the strongest viric technique ever ideated, ever created.

     There are two reasons why I think that we should focus on another mutating
     technique, in contrast to metamorphism:

     The main reason:  Even the theoretically best metamorphic virus is kind of
     static.  In the first instance, of course,  it can change the code of it's
     whole body.  But in the second instance,  the virus always  does  the same
     things -  it has the same behaviour as it's n-1 generation.  Moreover, all
     exchanges  of  the  opcodes are  manually programmed  by the  virus-author
     (which means,  a theoretically perfect metamorphic virus  can't be written
     with  the current  concept,  as  a viruswriter can  not find  all possible
     exchange-possibilities).

     A further reason why this statement is wrong: This is more a social reason
     than a techniqual. Writing a metamorphic virus requires advanced knowlegde
     of assembler,  CPU-functions (opcodes) and the file-format  (wheter  PE or
     ELF  or  something else).  As we could  have seen in previous years,  most
     virus  writers  quitted  before  having that  knowledge ->  they have  not
     written such complex viruses.  Conclusion:  It is just too complicated for
     being our best weapon against anti-virus programms.

     To sum up:  We need something better than metamophism,  which is easier to
     create. Impossible? I don't think so...



  2) Artificial Evolution

     When an  antivirus program  analyses  a file  infected by  a very  complex
     metamorphic virus (say XXX), it still finds out, that the file is infected
     by XXX, even the new virus looks totally  different as its n-1 generation.
     (->'<- means next, mutated generation):

       (XXX)' = XXX -> ((XXX)')' = XXX ...

     In my opinion, the only way to solve this fact is more or less total
     randomness. Not just in the first instance (the code itself) but also in
     the second instance (the behaviour).

     I'm thinking about real artificial evolution. The code of the virus should
     change itself,not by analysing itself - but (more or less) totally random.
     This is exactly  the same as nature does  (because of mistakes) - and it's
     called evolution.  In viruses, the main reason for this "evolution" should
     not be the  improvement of itself,  but the uncalculateable  result of the
     random changes. The result of such changes:

     (XXX)' <> XXX -> ((XXX)')' <> (XXX)' <> XXX

     Antivirus researchers can not figure out  wheter a virus is a new virus or
     a mutated version.  First, this is a very big problem in the "war of virus
     number and names of viruses";  second,  it will be a very  big problem for
     analyser to decide wheter something IS a virus or not. And most important:
     Any  variant  could  look  different in  the next  version,  impossible to
     recalculate,  impossible to automatically  detect all variants of a single
     virus.



  3) More or less

     Pure randomness not realistic, because most variants would fail.  To avoid
     most variants to fail,  techniques to  reduce the amount of  mis-mutations
     have to be used. As this field is new for viruses, good techniques must be
     developed (first theoretically, then for practice,of course). Two ways for
     avoiding mistakes already exist:  SEH (Structured Exception Handling)  can
     be used to  catch mistakes;  and  virtual-machine-like behaviour  could be
     used for testing  the random generated variants.  But I'm sure new ways to
     reduce mistakes will come to our minds...



  4) Outro

     In the game anti-virus-community versus virus-writing-community we can not
     score another important goal with the techniques nowadays.  Therefor a new
     technique  has to be used commonly.  First encrypted viruses (AVs detected
     them), polymorphic viruses  (AVs detected them),  metamorphic viruses (AVs
     detected them, too).  Now artificial evolution... In "Zmist Opportunities"
     Peter Ferrie and Peter Szor wrote:  "'So,  poly-encrypted permutated viral
     body is completely integrated with target file. Hmm ...  check-mate?'  Not
     this time, Zombie."  - With this technique, we will be once again one step
     ahead of the anti virus researchers.
