     Wikipedia is a free encyclopedia, and everybody who is interested in is allowed to
     write articles, change articles, vote for articles and more. The following text
     represents an idea for using this encyclopedia for malware. As wikipedia has
     become one of the most important places for gaining information in the www,
     I thought it would be a good environment for computerviruses. After some
     days of thinking and discovering, I got an idea, and will present it to you
     in this article...





  1) How does Wikipedia work

     When a user thinks that (s)he wants to improve an article, (s)he clicks at the
     buttom "edit this page" and receives a html-page containing a "form" containing
     a textarea with the whole text of the article. The URL of the article and the
     edit-page have always the same format.

     Original Page: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/[article-name]
           Example: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Kropotkin

     Edit Page: http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=[article-name]&action=edit
       Example: http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Peter_Kropotkin&action=edit

     Every header souce code of an Edit-Page has exactly the same format - first there
     are 3.663 static bytes - then the start of the form-tag, which is static again,
     but contains the article-name - which could have different length:

<form id="editform" name="editform" method="post" action="/w/index.php?title=Peter_Kropotkin&amp;action=submit"
enctype="multipart/form-data">

<textarea tabindex='1' accesskey="," name="wpTextbox1" id="wpTextbox1" rows='25'
cols='80' >
 - - - - - - - - [Header Of a Edit-Page Of Wikipedia]- - - - - - - -

     Next comes the whole text of the article in plain text containing wikipedia commands
     (explained later), and some more html and javascript code. Most of the code is unimportant
     for the idea, beside of these lines:


 - - - - - - - - [Part of a Edit-Page Of Wikipedia]- - - - - - - -
<input tabindex='5' id='wpSave' type='submit' value="Save page" name="wpSave" accesskey="s" title="Save your changes [alt-s]"/>
 - - - - - - - - [Part of a Edit-Page Of Wikipedia]- - - - - - - -

     By clicking this buttom, you can save the text you have written in the textarea-tag -
     it is submitted to "http:/en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Peter_Kropotkin&amp;action=submit".
     The PHP script on the server rewrites the html-page then (by using databases or something like
     that I guess) and everything is done. That's how it SHOULD work.





  2) The idea

     Everything a user can do, a code also can do. That means, we can change a wikipedia article
     by a computer code automatically.
       First of all, we have to download a edit-page (for example with 'URLDownloadToFile' API).
     Then we have to edit the downloaded file. We want to change the text in the textarea-tag - 
     and what is most important: We have to do something that automatically submits the form.
     About the first thing later (changing the text); how can we submit the form by itself?
     We have to include an "onload" to the body:

 - - - - - - - - - - - - - [The magic part]- - - - - - - - - - - - -
     <body ONLOAD="window.setTimeout('document.editform.submit()', 1 );">
 - - - - - - - - - - - - - [The magic part]- - - - - - - - - - - - -

     This body-tag submits the "editform" (see above in the Header of wikipedia) automatically
     after 1 millisecond. Theoretically we would just need the form-part now, but when we just
     use the form, wikipedia recognizes that something smells fishy, and gives following page:
     "Someone else has changed this page since you started editing it." Well, we do not want
     that, so just let's use the original page.

     Now something about the wikipedia-commands, and how to use them, and some other secrets.
     The idea is to change 100s of pages at wikipedia (what we could do later). How do we get
     100s of pages? The main idea of wikipedia seems to be connected information. Therefore
     inside the edit-form we can use the command "[[...]]" for making a internal link to another
     wikipedia article.

     We could search in the textarea for any [[...]] and download the next page. An example:


 - - - - - - - - - - - - - [Finding connections]- - - - - - - - - - - - -
Prince '''Peter Alexeevich Kropotkin''' (In [[Russian language|Russian]] ???? ??????´???? ?????´????)
([[December 9]], [[1842]] - [[February 8]], [[1921]]) was one of [[Russia]]'s foremost [[anarchism|anarchist]]s
and one of the first advocates of what he called "[[anarchist communism]]"     
 - - - - - - - - - - - - - [Finding connections]- - - - - - - - - - - - -

     In this shourt sentence we have found 8 more links to wikipedia-articles. All we have to
     do is to replace all spaces (" ") to underlines ("_") and copy the part before a potential
     "|" to the edit-page URL, and we have the direct link to all 8 articles:

http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Russian_language&action=edit
http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=December_9&action=edit
http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=1842&action=edit
http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=February 8&action=edit
http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=1921&action=edit
http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Russia&action=edit
http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=anarchism&action=edit
http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=anarchist_communism&action=edit

     A good page for starting a search for internal link is the page of "featured articles".
     (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_articles). There we could find a lot
     of very long articles, which are often very good connected to other articles - and have
     many external links in it.

     Another way to find new articles is the wikipedia-feature called "Random article".
     Downloading "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random", wikipedia returns a
     random article. First we have to get the name of the article (static place in the
     html-source) and insert the name into the edit-page URL.

     Well, now we know how to auto-submit text and how to find articles. What is missing
     is the way how to use it.


     1: The dump way - destruction
        It would be possible to replace all text in the textarea with nonsense. This would be
        of course worst case, and real destruction. Hope this never comes true!

     2: Political messages
        Of course, beside of nonsense, you could also spread real messages (like commenting on
        GWB's dump behaviour - whatever) - the good thing: As wikipedia is very popular, a lot
        of people will read your message. You can change something!

     3: Usage for malware
        I've mainy written and discovered the idea because this could also be used in malware.
        Wikipedia also uses external links. The syntax for such links:

        [URL text]
        [http://www.spth.de.vu/ Second Part To Hell]

        Imagine you have a webserver (or in best case: a worm installs a webserver on the host's
        computer), you could search for all external links in the textarea-tag - and replace
        the URL:

* [http://www.blackcrayon.com/people/kropotkin/ BlackCrayon.com: People: Peter Kropotkin]

        And after rewriting it becomes the following text:

* [http://213.239.195.143/worm.exe BlackCrayon.com: People: Peter Kropotkin]

        Most people trust wikipedia-links (yes, it is serios) - and I think this could be a
        good way for spreading.





  3) Last words

     Wikipedia is a great environment for information, which means that many people view
     and trust it. This is a perfect victim for new kind of viruses. The only way to prevent
     would be registered-only entrys or pictures with codes before every edit. But this
     would lead wikipedia to become a more closed environment than now.
