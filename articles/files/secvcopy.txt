  The title of this article sounds really strange and I'm sure, you can't think
  what I'll tell you now. Don't worry, you will get the point while reading this
  text. First I have to thank three persons, who's viruses or articles helped me
  to get this idea. First person is Benny, who wrote a great article called
  'Some ideaz about future worms', which was released in 29a#6. In his article he
  mentioned that a worm 'should not be stored at any file on the disk'. The second
  important person, who's virus helped me to get the idea and bring the idea to
  reallity was Lys Kovick with his WinREG.AntiREG. Last but not least Q the Misanthrope's
  virus Bat.OneLine wsa very important for this article. To all these guys I have to
  send out a really great 'THANK YOU'! :D Well you still can't think about my idea,
  so I'll stopp writing this silly intro and start to come to the important parts...




  1) The Idea

     The idea is, as you should have already noticed, a copy of the virus, which can't
     be detected. Let's consider the scan of a Antivirus-Program. The program detects
     every virus, which is already in the virus-definition, in (most times) every file
     at the computer. Now: What would be, if the virus doesn't exist in any file at the
     computer??? It is not detected. You may think, "Damn, silly boy, how should the virus
     work?". The answere's name is Registy...
     As you may know, you can run any program with the right extansion via the registry.
     That is the main point. You just have to store a copy of the virus/worm's code in registry
     (if it's script than it's easy, if it's a binary you have to debug it later on). Now
     let's think that the virus is in the registry, how we get it out from there?
     As I have already told you, you can run programs via registry... One of this programs
     you can run is called 'CMD.exe', the new Windows 2000 Command-Interpreter.
     The think get's tricky now: As you may know, your CMD.exe has a command called 'for',
     we are going to use it now. Why? Well, it's doubtful that your virus just have one line,
     therefore we have to use one line (registry just allows one line of CMD.exe-code) bringing
     your virus-code to a new file. Maybe you didn't fully understand what I meant, therefore
     I'll show you an example now. This is the content of a new registy-key, which is stored
     in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run:

     - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
     cmd /c for %a in ("@echo off" cls "echo Second Part To Hell was here..." pause exit) do @echo %~a>>C:\example.cmd
     - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

     Now guess the effects of this key! Every start-up of the computer it will generate a new
     file called C:\example.cmd with the code between the inverted commas. Cool we got
     a new file onto the computer... I'm sure that you know it: The code should be your virus
     code. :). Now let's say, a virus uses such a code. First run it installs the key with
     it's code. Some time later the user notices that something smells fishy and scanns trough
     the harddisk. It finds a few copies of the virus and delets it. Now the cool thing:
     It doesn't matter as the virus has it's code saved in the registry. And this code is ready
     to infect the computer again and again (and again...).




  2) Impotant marginal notes

     There are some stranges in that line, which you have to note, otherwise you will have
     hard problems getting the code working:

     a) Inverted commas
        You have to set the commands between inverted commands, if the line you want to write to
        a new file contains at least one blank space. Otherwise CMD.exe treat it as more commands
        with the side-effects, that it writes every part to a new line. If the command doesn't contain
        a blank space, you may not use inverted commas.


     b) 'exit'-command
        After writing all your code to a .CMD or .BAT file, you have to use an 'exit'-command, since
        you may write the whole code to the file every computer run. That's also the reason why
        you must not use lables or gotos.


     c) '@echo'-command
        You have to use @echo to write strings to a file. If you would use just 'echo', you would
        also write the primary command to it (i.e.: C:\Windows\System32>echo cls>>C:\example.cmd AND
        cls).

     d) '%~a'-option
        If you have used a multi-part-command (which contains blanc space[s]), you have to use inverted
        commands, as I have already told you. Using the simple '%a'-option, you would also write that
        inverted commas to the code (which you don't want I think). To write the code without that
        inverted commas you have to use '%~a'. (Of course, you could also use another variable-letter).

     e) '>>'-option
        When you try to use '>' to write your code to a file, you won't have success as CMD.exe overwrites
        everything in the file (the lines you have already written) with the new one with the result that
        the file contains JUST the last line you wanted to write.




  3) How to use it

     a) General Information
        I've already told you, how the technique works, but not how to use it. Well, here we are.
        First thing your virus should do when it's activ is to search the AutoStart-Directory, after
        that it should write the modified code (the code above with the new directory+filename) to the
        registry. That's all, easy - isn't it?! :)

     b) Where to store the code
        This is maybe the most important decision you have to make. Here are a few opportunities with
        it's pro and contra.

        --> Standart-Registry-Run
        For Example: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
        This is maybe the easiest and saved way to make sure that the virus will be started every
        computer-Run. But the problem is that even low- and and medium-knowlegde computer users know
        how to find a key here. That's a big problem...

        --> Command Processor-AutoRun
        HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor\AutoRun
        HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor\AutoRun
        The good thing is that nearly nobody knows about this key. The key forces the CMD.exe to
        run a command or a file before the real window opens. The code would run when the 
        user opens a .CMD/.BAT file or open directly the CMD.exe. The problem is that a normal user
        don's use these things. :(

        --> Hooking File-extansions
        malfunction wrote an article about that and released it in 29a#6. He used that technique
        to run a virus/worm-file before an .EXE is executed. We can use the same technique modified.
        just put the code above instead of malfunction's filename, and it should work.




  4) Last words

     Here, at the end of my article, I really want to thank you for still being with me and
     reading this. I am really happy that I've finally finished this technique and this article, and
     I would be even happier if you could send me your opinion of this way to make a secure virus copy.
     I know that this article looks like it's just a technique for batch viruses, but it isn't! You
     can use it in every file-virus/worm for Windows. Just use the command 'debug', which is really easy.
     As you can imaging, I will write such a virus as soon as possible, and for showing you that it's
     possible, it will become a binary virus. :)...
     Greets goes to everybody who knows me (I'm too lazy to write them all down again, you know who you
     are - just look at my homepage :D)...
     A special greets goes to my RainBow, ILD!
