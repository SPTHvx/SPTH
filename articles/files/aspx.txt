     This time I've found another victim: ASP.NET. It is a pre-compiled language
     running on web-servers like IIS. I want to explain 'pre-compiled' a little
     bit: The server, when it runs a specific file for the first time, compiles
     it for execution (not as i.E. PHP, which are just interpreted) and saves the
     compiled version of the file. The advantage: The next executions are a lot
     faster than at pre-processor languages like PHP. The advantage in contrast to
     ASP is that we can use the whole amount of functions, methods, classes provided
     by the .NET Framework. ASP.NET scripts can be written in VB.NET, C#, C++ and J#.
     I've desided to use VB.NET for this article. For the codes I've used .NET
     Framework 1.1 and 2.0 beta (at IIS), and the codes run at both environment.
     Well, now let's look at the ASP.NET infection :)







  1.) File infection

      a) Prepending

         As always, I would like to start with the prepender virus for giving you
         the first ideas of that language. As I was not able to find a command
         for getting the own path of the current executed file (__FILE__, %0, ...
         in other languages), the virus searchs in every *.aspx file in the standart
         wwwroot folder for itself. When it found itself, it searchs for victims
         and infect them. More detailed explained after the code.

         Long code for a simple prepender, hmm? Well, I already gave you the reason. Now the
         explanaion:

         --> Opens the standart folder of wwwroot ("C:\Inetpub\wwwroot")
         --> Gets all *.aspx files in there
         --> Searchs for its code in every *.aspx file
         --> Saves its codes
         --> Searchs for uninfected victims
         --> Reads the code
         --> Writes the viruscode and the original code to the file





      b) Appending

         This code is another standart-infection-type, so let's look at it. This time
         let's put the code after the original filecontent.

         There is not too much difference to the prepender code.

         --> Opens the standart folder of wwwroot ("C:\Inetpub\wwwroot")
         --> Gets all *.aspx files in there
         --> Searchs for its code in every *.aspx file
         --> Saves its codes
         --> Searchs for uninfected victims
         --> Reads the code
         --> Writes the original code and the viruscode to the file





      c) Entry Point Obscuring

         This is the first techniqually interesting type of infection: Anywhere in the middle: EPO
         The virus searchs for a valueable place which could be infected, and does it. To be more
         precicly it searchs for a code between the html-statements. That means, it searchs for
         '>' to infect that place. Better explanation follows at the end.

  2) Polymorphism

     a) Variable Changing

        This is a standart polymorphism technique for script-viruses - and I think
        it should be done in every infectable language; so I desided to do it here
        too. Every polymorphism needs random numbers. The .NET Framework provides the
        random numbers not as function or methode (as it's in most other languages),
        but as System.Random - Object. This is quite strange, but not more difficult -
        just different. Well, variable changing means to rename every variable or function
        name in the whole code. As there is no command for the own file (or at least I
        did not find one), I used a static path-name. But that does not mind, because
        in a real virus we have to search for the own code anyway.

    b) Adding Trash

       Now let's try to add some trash into the ASP.NET code. First think: What could be trash?
       I thought of the following stuff:
       -> Commends:
                * Rem anything
                * ' anything
       -> Variable Definition:
                * Dim [anything] As String
                * Dim [anything] As String = "[Anything]"
                * Dim [anything] As Integer

       There would be much more possible junk, but for the first try, let's use these six
       different options. (Some further thinks would be the writing of not used objects like
       Dim anything As new System.Random() or other stuff.)

    c) Number Changing

       This is polymorphism technique which I've already done in JS, PHP and Ruby 
       (see rRlf #5, 29a#7 and 29a#8)- but it is a real good technique, therefore
       I wanted to do it in ASP.NET with VB.NET too. The idea is that numbers can
       also be seen as calculations. That means 666 = 999-333 = 333+333 = 1332 / 2
       It's an easy princip - but it works fine. And it helps against simple detection
       of the virus. Let's see first an later calculation of a nice number, then the
       code of the engine:

       666=((((6093/9)-(28/4))+(((224/7)/(5-1))-((40/1)/(9-1))))-(-((10/(14-9))-1)+((36+(28/(1+6)))/5)))

    d) Lower/Upper Case Games

       This polymorphism technique was just able to bring to reality, because I've used
       VB.NET. That language is NOT Case-Sensitive, (in contrast to C++.NET or C#). The
       idea is, that every letter can be written uppercase or lowercase. The advantage:
       AVers can not use simple scan strings - combined with the other techniques, this
       is a strong way to fuck the detection of a virus. Now the code:

<%@ Page Language="VB" Debug="True" %>
<script runat="server">
Sub Page_Load (ByVal Sender As Object, ByVal E As EventArgs)
  Dim my_file_name As String = "C:\Inetpub\wwwroot\localstart.aspx"
  Dim my_file_code, new_file_code, my_code_line, found_number As String
  Dim i As Integer
  Dim my_arr_obj As new System.Random()
  Dim file_pointer As New System.IO.StreamReader(my_file_name)
  Do
    my_code_line=file_pointer.ReadLine()
    my_file_code=my_file_code+my_code_line+Chr(13)+Chr(10)
  Loop Until my_code_line Is Nothing
  file_pointer.Close

  For i=1 To my_file_code.Length
    If Asc(Mid(my_file_code,i,1))>64 And Asc(Mid(my_file_code,i,1))<91 And my_arr_obj.Next(3)=1 Then
      new_file_code=new_file_code+Chr(Asc(Mid(my_file_code,i,1))+32)
    ElseIf Asc(Mid(my_file_code,i,1))>96 And Asc(Mid(my_file_code,i,1))<123 And my_arr_obj.Next(3)=1 Then

    Else
      new_file_code=new_file_code+Mid(my_file_code,i,1)
    End If

  file_Wpointer.WriteLine(new_file_code)
  file_Wpointer.Close
End Sub

         --> Writes new code to the file





    e) Space Games

       This technique uses the behaviour of VB.NET scripts, that they simply ignore multi
       space between commands. That means: "End Sub" == "    End       Sub   "
       By using that technique, AVers can not use simple scan-strings again. They have to
       build in a function for ignoring multible spaces. And, as the other techniques too,
       this means more work. In combination with other techniques: The less they can detect
       static, the harder they have to work, and the more difficult it becomes to find a
       valueable detection. Now the code:

  Dim i As Integer

    my_code_line=file_pointer.ReadLine()
    my_file_code=my_file_code+my_code_line+Chr(13)+Chr(10)

  file_pointer.Close

    f) Colon Games

       The last polymorphism-engine I'll show you uses the character ':'. This one can
       be used for VB/VBS/VB.NET codes to combine 2 files without Chr(13,10). As this could
       be used for viruses too, i've written that engine. Sometimes the code changes Chr(13,10)
       to colons and sometimes the opposite. This makes the virus look quite different every
       version. 'Sub ... ()' and 'End Sub' have to be in the same line, and therefore the code
       ignores every Chr(13,10), which has a space before. (This is important if you want to
       copy/paste/rewrite the code.) Well, let's look at the last code of this article:

  Do
    my_code_line=file_pointer.ReadLine()

  Loop Until my_code_line Is Nothing

  new_file_code=new_file_code+Mid(my_file_code,1,1)
  For i=2 To my_file_code.Length
    If Mid(my_file_code,i,2)=Chr(13)+Chr(10) And my_arr_obj.Next(4)=1 Then
      If Mid(my_file_code,i-1,1)<>">" And Mid(my_file_code,i-1,1)<>" " Then
        new_file_code=new_file_code+chr(58)

  3) Last words

     Another file-type is ready for infection since this article. I'm happy that I've finally
     finished it, and that Microsoft's answere to PHP is on the list of my victims now, too. :)
     I have already mentioned at the beginning of the article, you could write ASP.NET viruses
     with C# or C++.NET too, but I think for this time it's ok. About ASP.NET: It's really a highly
     interesting language, has alot of interesting feature for 'real' coding, is very easy to handle
     client and server communication and can use the whole appility of the .NET Framework. For this
     time - it's enough. See you out there soon! :D
