  What is this article about and why do I write it? This may me your first questions
  when you see the title. Well, I'll answere you: In this article you can read my (theoretically)
  ideas of the future of Batch and a small view of the rached goals in the past.
  Why do I write it? I just want to tell everybody, who is interested in it, my ideas of the
  future goal and some neverdone things, because it's doubtful that I'll code much batch in
  future. Well, I hope that you will like my ideas and thoughts. And now go on reading more
  important things than this little intro. :)




  1) Short view of the reached goals

     As every virus language, also batch has it's one history. I want to give you some
     interesting things I found out about this topic. It could be that I forgot some things,
     please forgive me. :D Well, let's go.

     a) Encryption and other Anti Detections
        This technique first appeared in 2000, when Duke released his 'Advanced Batch Mutator'.
        Meanwhile there are other and maybe stronger ways to make the batch code unreadable.
        Guys like PhileT0ast3r and Alcopaul made a virus called Bat.Calvin&Hobbes, which was
        encrypted via a vbs-file. I discovered the set-encrypten and the pseudo-trash, SAD1c made
        great things like including trash and hard-encryption via vbs in his BOM (2003). Also
        Tim Strazzere wrote a tool called BatchEncrypter, which changed the view of a batch file.
        Another very important technique was seen in 'Trojan.NoDelDir' by an unknown author. The
        technique was included to various VCKs (BOM, BWG, DM,...). Another idea found in 2003 was
        the EICAR-file-including, idead by Doctor Rave.

     b) Polymorphism
        Even polymorphism is much harder to create, it was done before the encryption developed.
        The first polymorph batch virus was written by GliTCH in 1999 (?) and was released in his
        article called 'GliTCH's Polymorphic Batch Tutorial'. Even it was the first try, the
        thing wasn't very successful, because every generation the virus' size increases alot.
        Next try was my BatXP.Saturn, which used CMD.exe (Win00+) instead of command.com (Win9x).
        One other polymorphic virus was BatXP.Palindrom, which used permutation and variable-name
        changing. Another polymorphic Bath virus was SAD1c's BAT.PureFilth, Bat.Micromorph and the
        output of his BOM. One other guy who wrote a polymorphic batch virus was Kefi with his BatXP.on.
        Alcopaul also wrote an article about 'BatXP polymorphism via vbs'. PhileT0aster made a great
        batch morphing engine, and discovered a cool type of random number generator, which was also
        used in his and my Bat/BatXP.Iaafe. In 2003 rRlf anounced a contest about writing the best
        poly-virus which runs from Win95-WinXP. Toro won with his Bat.Tee. In 2003 even CWarrior wrote
        an interesting batch mutator. The last guy who joined the club of batch mutants writer was DvL
        with his Bat.Limitrophe.a.

     c) Entry Point Obscuring
        That technique was the last totally new major technique I know. In 2003 I wrote some ideas
        to DvL and forgot about them. The things came back into my mind when I read BZ#4 in 2004, where
        DvL wrote a something about EPO in batch. Than I sat down and tried out things and made
        BatXP.Nihilist, the first EPO batch virus. As this article is written short after the virus
        I can't say anything about the future of it.




  2) Present situation

     The present situation in batch virus writing is hard to explain. There are a couple of batch
     virus writers or people who write batch sometimes. I think there are 10-15 who create malware
     via batch. Maybe the most important thing in the current damn good situation of batch writing
     is DvL's BATch Zone. The situation developed, I think, in 2002/2003, because DvL started his
     BATch Zone Magazine, SAD1c made the best Virus Creator for Batch (Batch-O-Matic) and other
     guys discovered great techniques. Nowadays Batch authors want to create new, inovative stuff,
     and discovering new techniques. And it changes even more to BatXP, which uses WinNT/00/XP's
     CMD.exe. That file contains much more commands than command.com, and you can do virus-related
     stuff much easier. But so far there are many undiscovered commands, so we don't know what future
     could bring to us...





  3) Future goals

     a) Discover more of CMD.exe

        In my opinion, CMD.exe could be the only future of batch, because old command.com is just used
        by old OSes like Win95/98/Me(?). Command.com was the battle-field of batch-viruses for years
        (since Ralf Burger's first batch virus in 1987). Moreover it's intelligent to use the new field,
        because it allows great virus-related stuff, which weren't possible or which were not as easy to
        make in command.com. I'm talking about techniques like infection all files at the HD, easy poly-
        morphism, EPO, net spreading (not done yet?). I know that there will be more great techniques
        which hasn't been done with command.com.

     b) Polymorphism

        i) Adding Trash

           This is another polymorphism technique, which is possible to do. I got the idea when I saw
           PhileT0ast3r's Mutanting Engine. It should be easy to write any silly commands to the code:

           ----
           trash
           command1
           command2
           trash
           trash
           command3
           trash
           command4
           trash
           ...
           ----



       ii) Multi-Polymorphism

           So far there are 2 different types of already discovere pure-batch polymorphism:
           Permutation and Variable-Name Changing (which are already combined). After discovering
           also the 3rd type (Adding Trash), it would be of much value to combine these three.
           This is a sample of the file, how does it look like:

           ----                ----      
           %AAAA%... \         trash
           %AAAA%...  \        %Bhsk%...
           %BBBB%...   \       %Bhsk%...
           %BBBB%...    \__\   trash
           %CCCC%...    /  /   %Cooq%...
           %CCCC%...   /       %Cooq%...
           %DDDD%...  /        trash
           %DDDD%... /         %Doej%...
           ----                %Doej%...
                               trash
                               %Arrs%...
                               %Arrs%...
                               trash
                               ----



     c) Permutation with Multi-EPO

        This strange combination could be the best technique in batch ever ideat. I got the idea
        by jackie, who told me that this could be a great technique for JavaScript. As I think,
        it's also possible in Batch, I wanted to write this idea here. I'll show you the idea
        via pseudo-code:

        Uninfected File   +       Virus          =          Infected File
         ____________             __________            _________
        |    com A   |           |  %VIR A% |          | com A   |
        |    com B   |           |  %VIR B% |          | %VIR C% |
        |    com C   |    |      |  %VIR C% |  _______ | com B   |
        |    com D   | ___|___   |  %VIR D% |          | %VIR D% |
        |    com E   |    |      |__________|  _______ | com C   |
        |    com F   |    |                            | com D   |
        |____________|                                 | %VIR A% |
                                                       | com E   |
                                                       | %VIR B% |
                                                       | com F   |
                                                       |_________|
        
         The virus splits into n parts, and then put the n parts in any order between the victim
         file. The different parts are joined by goto & lables. To run the virus first in file you
         include a goto infront of the real code to the first virus part. I'm sure it will be
         much work, but remember: 2-hours viruses are nonsence. :D



     d) Improve old techniques

        There are many techniques, which aren't perfect so far. Examples are the EPO, Polymorphism -
        Variable Name changing, Encryption (however which type). As you can see, there are still many
        things, which could be improved. Maybe also techniques like Multi-OSing (Win95-WinXP runable virus)
        are not perfect so far. I don't think of viruses, that uses the same commands for every OS, but
        a virus, which uses different codes for CMD.exe and command.com (like PhileT0ast3r's and my
        Bat/BatXP.Iaafe).



  4) Last words

     Comming to an end I want to say that I'm happy that I wrote these ideas and thoughts down, because
     I don't if I can finish it (I've many other projects: CTG, MenuetOS, PEs, ...). It's also a new
     challange for everybody who is interested in batch, and who thinks that (s)he is able to show
     new great stuff. I'm sure that guys like PhileT0ast3r, Kefi, DvL or Alcopaul are able to do it.
     As there are damn much information around about batch and BatchXP, it shouldn't be as hard as
     you may think. I would be happy if I can see some of my ideas brought to reality new few month,
     otherwise I know that I did everything batch related for nothing. For me it's most important to
     see that I could help any other virus writer with my codes and ideas. And the only way you can show
     me that is to bring these ideas to batch code. :)
     I hope that you don't hate me now because it's a 100% theoretically article, but in my opinion
     getting new ideas is at least as important as code this ideas. It would also be damn happy if
     I could read some other articles about new ideas very soon. As you can see I just collected a
     few ideas about 'Fake AV' ways. Maybe anybody else could make the same about new spreading ways of
     batch. Well that's more than enough (and even more than I wanted to write :D), see you out there
     soon...
