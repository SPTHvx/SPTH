  Today, while playing around with my Hex Editor, I found a funny problem (just to don't call
  it bug) at WindowsXP's NotePad. This problem may be used as a funny, non-destructive payload
  for viruses. Well, I'll explain you what I found:

  When you write something in NotePad 5.1 and you want to save it, you can choose between these
  things:

  - ANSI
  - Unicode
  - Unicode Big Endian
  - UTF-8

  Let's say, we've written a shourt text ('abc-123') and we want to save it now. It will
  have the following form, if you look at it with a HexEditor:

  -> ANSI: 61,62,63,2D,31,32,33
     Everthing is as it should be.

  -> Unicode: FF,FE,61,00,62,00,63,00,2D,00,31,00,32,00,33,00
     A FF & FE infront of the code (to show NotePad that it's Unicode) and a 0h after every
     sign (as it should be in Unicode).

  -> Unicode Big Endian: FE,FF,00,61,00,62,00,63,00,2D,00,31,00,32,00,33
     The same as Unicode but the 0h infront of the every sign.

  -> UTF-8: EF,BB,BF,61,62,63,2D,31,32,33,00,31,00,32,00,33
     You can see it by yourself :)


  Forget the last two formats, and look at Unicode.
  What if we write ANSI, but add a FFh + FEh infront of the code, like this one:

  Example: FF,FE,61,62,63,2D,31,32,33

  Notepad 5.1 'thinks' it's a Unicode because of the Unicode-mark infront of the code.
  The result is that you can't view at the code, you just see some strange signs. :)
  You can't even change it with NotePad since the Unicode-Mark don't exist there, however,
  you didn't destroy anything because the data still exist.

  In my opinion this could be a really cool payload for a virus, and I would like to see
  the faces of an infected user when (s)he notices that all .txt files are looking strange. ;)

  Now, at the end of my little story, I want to say 'Thank you' for reading this and I hope
  you like this! :D
