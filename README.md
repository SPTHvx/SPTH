<a name="11082019"></b><b>11.08.2019:</b><font size="2"> My old domain (spth.virii.lu) has been down now for some time (thanks a lot perforin for hosting it!). I decided to upload the news-page (basically a logbook over the past 17 years), my <a href="articles/">articles and interviews</a>, as well as <a href="viruses/">codes</a> to github. Many links in this logbook are broken, but for reasons of nostalgia i will keep everything as it is. Please enjoy some old ideas on self-replicating codes, artificial life, artificial evolution, metamorphism, ... If you have cool idea or projects, let <a href="mailto:sperl.thomas@gmail.com">me</a> know.<br><br>
<a name="05042014"></b><b>05.04.2014:</b><font size="2"> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGBM5vWiBLo">High Hopes</a>!<br><br>
</font><a name="08022014"></b><b>08.02.2014:</b><font size="2"> <a href="https://twitter.com/mikko">Mikko Hypponen</a> has mentioned my research in <a href="http://spth.virii.lu/InfectingDNA.txt">infecting biological DNA with digital Computer Code</a> in his <a href="http://sms.cam.ac.uk/media/1649555">talk in Cambridge on "Silicon Plagues"</a> (see minute 51++). My code was inspired and uses the <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/content/329/5987/52.abstract">ideas of Craig Venter's synthetic life research</a>. They try to understand DNA in such a level that it becomes a tool solve important problems of humanity, such as creation of fuel, food or medicine at superfast and efficient rates. A great summary by him is given on his <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdgfzdlgUHw">TEDx talk on Future Biology</a>.<br>
The idea is clear: Similar as we can use electronic computers to perform logical tasks, they want to control DNA in such a way that it can perform biological tasks which are unfeasible otherwise. Examples mentioned above - fuel, food, medicine, you are only bounded by your imagination.<br><br>
I am a bit worried about the risk of abusing such techniques by criminals, nation states, you name it. Similar as computers are abused and can cause alot of trouble, also synthized DNA can be abused, but obviously on a much more dangerous scale. Compared to that, abusing computers seems like some kiddy games.<br>
Per fortuna, yet we are far from the point were synthesizing DNA and booting up bacteria with it is possible on a big scale (Venter compares it with the 40s or 50s of electronic computers). Actually, afaik Craig Venter's lab is the only place where this can be done yet.<br><br>
As a conclusion I think Mikko's statement "<i>Do not write a computer virus that is able to infect DNA</i>" is of course true, but naive.<br>
Synthezised DNA has the potential to change our lifes in future tremendously (maybe similar or even more than computers have done), but can (and most likely will) be abused aswell - obviously in a much worse way than computers can ever be.<br><br>
I wonder if somebody is thinking about serios solutions. Those bio-researchers have done some ethical studies, but I don't know how they evaluate the long-term risk. And security-people might be not be interested, as there has not been any accident yet or because the field is too different. Well, maybe it's SciFi after all.<br><br><br>
</font><a name="25112013"></b><b>25.11.2013:</b><font size="2"> I have just announced <a href="http://vxheaven.org/forum/viewtopic.php?id=2467">valhalla#5</a> vx-magazine. It will be a special issue celebrating hh86's <a href="http://vxheaven.org/?year=2009">5th birthday</a> on 27.11.2014. Deadline is exactly in 365 days - so hurry up with your projects :-) I have some nice ideas for my next projects, was able to solve some things which I was thinking about for years. Hope that many people join again in this issue; i'vealready seen some of other people's project and they are wonderful; I'm excited to see the outputs :-)<br><br>
</font><a name="05112013"></b><b>05.11.2013:</b><font size="2"> Finally I have uploaded my things in <a href="v4/">valhalla#4</a>: An article that explains how a <a href="InfectingDNA.txt">digital computer code can infect biological DNA, thus spread in the biological world as a self-replicating bacteria</a> (and the corresponding PoC code called <a href="InfDNA.rar">Mycoplasma mycoides SPTH-syn1.0</a>). My second article was about a way to <a href="CrossMeta.txt">infect many different programming languages with just one code, based on a special Meta-Language</a>, the corresponding <a href="Polygamy.rar">code can infect five languages (JS, VBS, MatLab, Ruby, Python), I called it Polygamy</a>. Furthermore, i did three very interesting interviews with <a href="intRGB.txt">roy g biv</a>, <a href="intJP.txt">JPanic</a> (both together with hh86) and <a href="intJeffDahmer.txt">Jeff Dahmer</a>.<br><br>
In general, the quality of valhalla#4 was very high. We saw the source of JPanic's <a href="http://spth.virii.lu/v4/articles/jpanic/JPanic-MP-VX.txt">Windows/Linux/MacOS cross-infector and an detailed explanation</a> of the technique behind. He also write a tutorial about <a href="http://spth.virii.lu/v4/articles/jpanic/JPanic-MP-VX.txt">Linux 64bit infection</a> (and we believe to know what his next project will be ;-)). roy g biv submitted his collection of <a href="http://spth.virii.lu/v4/codes/roy_g_biv/Quines.txt">quine-based infectors for 32 (!) different languages</a> - most of them you find on the <a href="LIP.html">Language Infection Project</a>. M0SA showed how one can <a href="http://spth.virii.lu/v4/articles/m0sa/evade.html">circumvent automated dynamic analysis</a> with surprisingly simple techniques. r3s1stanc3 shows a new and unexpected technique for worms, <a href="http://spth.virii.lu/v4/articles/r3/mailworm_gpg.txt">based on GPG encryption and web-based keyservices</a>. And hh86 analysed the deep dark corner of native GPU languages (who's binary form is undocumented!) for <a href="http://spth.virii.lu/v4/articles/hh86/CUPTX.TXT">encryption</a> and <a href="http://spth.virii.lu/v4/articles/hh86/GPUFF.TXT">file-infection</a>. Furthermore she shows how one can infect <a href="http://spth.virii.lu/v4/articles/hh86/CLASSI.TXT">Java Class with Win32 files</a>, and the <a href="http://spth.virii.lu/v4/articles/hh86/JBSO.TXT">other way round</a> (and i wish she combines those two kitties, to get a full Java/W32 cross-infector). Another surprising and high-quality submission was a huuuge (more 7000 lines of C) <a href="http://spth.virii.lu/v4/codes/black_sun/Ether.txt">metamorphic code written by Black Sun</a>. As I said, this was a wonderful release, awesome work of many people. And - I already heared rumors of follow up projects by several of the above mentioned people, it will be awesome!! :-)<br><br>
I also updated my <a href="links.htm">link</a>-section. If you think I missed somebody, please <a href="mailto:sperl.thomas@gmail.com">send me a message</a>.<br><br><br>

</font><a name="16102013"></b><b>16.10.2013:</b><font size="2"> After a small break, I'm back again. Yesterday, pr0mix and others released Inception#1 e-zine: <a href="inception1/">see online</a> or <a href="inception1/inception1.zip">download</a>. It has very nice personalized intro-pictures to every article - that's so cool. And the content is also good/interesting. Some nice essays - haven't seen such types of texts since the very old-school e-zines in 90s or early 2000s. Nice work guys, hope you continue!<br><br>There will be another vx-magazine out very soon - valhalla#4 (read <a href="http://vxheaven.org/forum/viewtopic.php?id=2199">hh86's annoucement</a>). I know that there will be some fancy stuff inside again. I have contributed aswell some things, again :-) The last one I just finished two days ago, its an idea+implementation about artificial life. I would say its my most creative thing I've done in my &gt;11years vx-career. Maybe a bit "too creative" :-) you will see. If you want to be part of valhalla-ezine, contact <a href="mailto:agonisthh86(at)gmail.com">hh86</a> before 1st of november. :-)<br><br><br> 
</font><a name="06072013"></b><b>06.07.2013:</b><font size="2"> <a href="http://vxheaven.org/">VX Heaven</a> is back online, after more than a year of down-time due to an incredible stupid, unfounded raid. I'm looking forward to information about what happend exactly, I guess we can hear something about this soon. Now - let's enjoy our library and discussion-platform again :-)<br><br> 
</font><a name="02072013"></b><b>02.07.2013:</b><font size="2"> Today, <a href="http://ezine.vxnetw0rk.ws/mag5/">DarK-CodeZ #5</a> has been released. You find several nice things in it, among others, 15 source-codes of first-time infected programming languages from genetix, roy g biv, hh86, herm1t and perforin (which I have separatly mentioned on the <a href="LIP.html">Language Infection Project</a> subpage). My small contributions are two interviews, one with <a href="inthh86_2.txt">hh86</a> and one with <a href="intGenetix.txt">genetix</a>. I have not read all things yet, but two things I find already pretty nice: one text by <a href="hh86/">hh86</a> about <a href="http://ezine.vxnetw0rk.ws/mag5/TEXTS/hh86/EPO64_hh86.TXT">EPO In Windows 64-bit</a>, where she explains a technique used in a former virus by her, and one new technique - which I predict to come true soon ;-). Second interesting thing: perforin wrote a <a href="http://ezine.vxnetw0rk.ws/mag5/VIEWER/arcusdaemonica.html">malicous program with PostScript languages</a>, thats the native langauges of printers, and many PDF files are compiled via PS files. I guess with a bit more research, its also possible to write a self-replicator for this fine language - something I would like to see :-). OK, well done perforin and R3s1stanc3, thanks for this magazine!<br><br>         
</font><a name="19062013"></b><b>19.06.2013:</b><font size="2"> As she has no own homepage, hh86 gets her own corner at my page, with a collection of all her viruses and articles: <a href="hh86/">hh86 corner</a>. Welcome! Maybe I can also convince her to write some interesting guest comments some day :-)<br><br>
</font><a name="09062013"></b><b>09.06.2013:</b><font size="2"> For my <a href="ezines.html">online ezine section</a>, I just uploaded online versions of *-zine from 1999 (<a href="asterix1/">#1</a>, <a href="asterix1/">#2</a>), and 40hex from 1991-1995 (<a href="40hex1/">#1</a>, <a href="40hex2/">#2</a>, <a href="40hex3/">#3</a>, <a href="40hex4/">#4</a>, <a href="40hex5/">#5</a>, <a href="40hex6/">#6</a>, <a href="40hex7/">#7</a>, <a href="40hex8/">#8</a>, <a href="40hex9/">#9</a>, <a href="40hex10/">#10</a>, <a href="40hex11/">#11</a>, <a href="40hex12/">#12</a>, <a href="40hex13/">#13</a>, <a href="40hex14/">#14</a>). 40hex was one of the best and most well-known magazines from the early 90s.<br><br>
Some highlights from the magazines: <a href="asterix1/intsep.html">Interview with Sepultura/IR</a> (who came back very recently and released a cross infector for Windows, Linux and OS-X), <a href="asterix2/articles/winfuture.html">text about future viruses ideas from 1999</a>, short explanation about <a href="40hex1/40HEX-1.004.txt">encryption for viruses</a> in 1991, an article about <a href="40hex2/40HEX-2.005.txt">Dark Avanger</a> that (among many other things) says that Dark Avanger created an AV (!). Some <a href="40hex4/40HEX-4.013.txt">jokes</a> that maybe nobody has seen for 20years, great texts and codes by Dark Angel such as his poly-engine <a href="40hex11/40HEX-11.002.txt">DAME</a>, texts about <a href="40hex12/40HEX-12.003.txt">Self Dis-Infecting File</a>, a virus (<a href="40hex14/40HEX-14.011.txt">JUMP by Strombringer</a>) that uses overlapping code as obfuscation (i used overlapping code in a polymorphic code <a href="w32.kitti.rar">W32.Kitti</a>) and many many many more awesome stuff!<br><br><br>
</font><a name="08062013"></b><b>08.06.2013:</b><font size="2"> Peter Ferrie has written an analysis for my <a href="Transcriptase.rar">JS.Transcriptase</a> (the first metamorphic script virus) - see <a href="transcript.pdf">Read your transcript</a>.<br><br>Due to the huge unexpected success of the <a href="LIP.html">Language Infection Project</a> (there are now already 33 new infected languages), I decided to annonce a LIP-zine. Still the best codes should go to general VX magazines such as valhalla or Dark-CodeZ, however, simpler codes which infect new languages can go to this collection. I will release it someday after <a href="http://vxnetw0rk.ws/#news">DarK-CodeZ#5</a> (which will appear in about one month), but before valhalla#4 (which was scheduled for some bright day at the end of the year). If you want to be part of LIP-zine, find a new yet uninfected language and hit it for the first time :-)<br><br><br> 
</font><a name="26052013"></b><b>26.05.2013:</b><font size="2"> So there has been this W32/Linus/OSX infector recently - most likely written by "Sepultura", a former member of Immortal Riot - one of the first virus-writing groups from the 1990s. For that reason, I have uploaded in the <a href="ezines.htm">Online VX e-Zines</a>-section the magazines from that group: <a href="ir1/">Insane Reality#1</a> (07.1993), <a href="ir2/">Insane Reality#2</a> (11.1993), <a href="ir3/">Insane Reality#3</a> (01.1994), <a href="ir4/">Insane Reality#4</a> (04.1994), <a href="ir5/">Insane Reality#5</a> (07.1994), <a href="ir6/">Insane Reality#6</a> (11.1994), <a href="ir7/">Insane Reality#7</a> (12.1995), <a href="ir8/">Insane Reality#8</a> (12.1996)... *nostalgia*<br><br> 
Beside of that, roy g biv (who actually also started to code viruses more than 20years ago in 1992) continued his series of quine-based source-code infectors. His latest creations is a self-replicator for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SmallBASIC">SmallBASIC</a> and the compiled version of Haskell. Well done! Hope more people continue joining the <a href="LIP.html">Language Infection Project</a> - there are many very interesting and challanging projects yet to be done, for example - my Top7: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog">Prolog</a>, <a href="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAS_language">SAS</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LabView">LabView</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Ct">cT</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam_programming_language">occam</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X10_%28programming_language%29">x10</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VHDL">VHDL</a> (for VHDL, herm1t as well as rgb said its impossible. but I disagree with them - can you prove them wrong? :-) )<br><br><br>
</font><a name="23052013"></b><b>23.05.2013:</b><font size="2"> <a href="http://pferrie.host22.com/">Peter Ferrie</a> has written an analysis of a new virus for VB 06.2013 - its called "Multi-platform Madness", and its about a virus called "{W32/Linux/OSX}/Clapzok". Now it seems like this virus is an advanced version of <a href="http://spth.virii.lu/rrlf7/sources/clt.htm">{W32/Linux}.Capzloq by JPanic in rRlf#7 from 2006</a> - with additional infection of OSX files. This is awesome for more reasons: First, it seems to be the first multiplatform virus for those three OSes, thats defintivly great work! Secondly, JPanic decided to code an advanced version of this great code 7 years later, so maybe one very high-skilled person found his way back. But now, who is JPanic? He writes <em>JPanic (aka Sepultura, aka The Soul Manager)</em>. Now check out that: <a href="https://www.google.at/search?q=inurl%3Aspth.virii%20sepultura">Sepultura in old magazines</a> - JPanic/Sepultura is a viruswriter from the 1990s, was a principal <a href="http://spth.virii.lu/29a2/29A-2.1_8.txt">member of "Immortal Riot"</a>. OK - I hope this great viruswriter will keep staying here for some moments - nothing more to say... (thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/hh86_">hh86</a> for the initial information)<br><br>   
</font><a name="08042013"></a><b>08.04.2013:</b><font size="2"> It seems like there is no day without a new platform hit for the first time. Today, there are two new platforms. One by psychologic for <a href="CSH.rar">C Shell</a>. The other one by genetix for the functional language <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocaml">Ocaml</a> (the source of the OCaml virus will be released soon). Well done to both of you, and have fun on the <a href="LIP.html">Great Wall of LIP participations</a>! :-)<br><br>
</font><a name="03042013"></a><b>03.04.2013:</b><font size="2"> The <a href="LIP.html">Language Infection Project</a> makes great progress - there are already 14 (!!!) new targets hit since its announcement 3 months ago. This is a huge success. The main-contributor was genetix, and most of the sources will be released in forthcoming magazines such as <a href="http://vxnetw0rk.ws/#news">DarK-CodeZ #5</a> (i promised to contribute something there as well - huh, should get my hands on some good projects i guess :-) ).<br><br>
It has been more than a year now that our library <a href="http://vx.netlux.org/index.html">VX Heavens</a> got burned down. Unfortunatly, there is still no official announcement about any progress. In any way, I have a good feeling that everything becomes solved in some time.<br><br>
It seems like that one of the best and most active viruswriters - hh86 - took a break. While she took breaks also in past times, for some reason I think its a bit different this time. She has written some of the most interesting viruses in recent times (just look at <a href="http://pferrie.host22.com/papers/mikasa.pdf">Peter Ferrie's latest analysis</a> about her <a href="http://spth.virii.lu/v3/vessel/display/articles/hh86/inline.txt">W32.UNIT00</a>). Furthermore, she was the initiator and editor of the valhalla magazine series (see <a href="v0/">v0</a>, <a href="v1/">v1</a>, <a href="v2/">v2</a>, <a href="v3/">v3</a>). Of course I hope that she comes back again some day, but I also understand that after such an highly productive VX career, one needs a break. (in any case, if you read this, drop me a mail - two proposals are left).<br><br><br>

For convenience, I have uploaded an <a href="v3/">online version of valhalla#3</a>. Contributors are hh86, roy g biv, (o), R3s1stanc3 and myself; herm1t wrote a nice guest comment and interviewees are <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/ericfiliol/">Eric Filiol</a>, <a href="http://www.cs.sjsu.edu/~stamp">Mark Stamp</a> and VirusBuster/ex-29A. The magazine contains so many new ideas about self-replicating codes: viruses with many new methods to obfuscate themselves, by using neverused novel instruction-sets, virtual code, own debuggers or inline JScript/CFF scripts; new true RNGs in viruses, infections of JAR files using JavaCompiler, ... <br><br>
I have uploaded my contributes separately on my page. My main contribute is the <a href="Transcriptase.rar">first metamorphic script virus, written in JavaScript</a> and an article which describes <a href="MSCJS.txt">how the metamorphism and self-compiling compiler is implemented in JavaScript</a>. A second article is about <a href="MetaLanguage.txt">meta-level languages used in viruses</a> and what the highest level language could be. One text deals with <a href="BTTF.txt">past expectations of viruswriters about the future of computerviruses</a>, there I collected quotes from 42 interviews with VXers back to 1993, and in the end give a prognosis myself. Highly interesting interviews with <a href="intEricFiliol.txt">Eric Filiol</a> (head of EICAR) and <a href="intMarkStamp.txt">Mark Stamp</a> (professor and academic reseracher in computer virology) have been done, giving clear neutral pictures of the potential advancements and problems with computer viruses and fascinating insights and opinions on military usage of malware. Together with hh86, we <a href="intVirusBuster.txt">interviewed VirusBuster mainly about 29A</a>.<br><br>
The editor of valhalla and one of the best viruswriters has finally got a new homepage: <a href="http://hh86.virii.lu/">hh86's room</a>. Another contributor of valhalla3 and member of <a href="http://ezine.vxnetw0rk.ws/">DarK-CodeZ</a> has a homepage too: <a href="http://r3s1stanc3.virii.lu/">r3s1stanc3</a>.<br><br>
Virus-writing is obviously alive. Our main library, <a href="http://vx.netlux.org">VX heavens maintained by herm1t</a>, is still temporarily unavailable - but I expect it to be back soon. Meanwhile, Perforin (who is also my host) provides <a href="http://download.adamas.ai/">big parts of VXers history</a> such as many of the most important ancient and modern e-zines, and <a href="http://cryptohub.nl/zines/vxheavens/">DrWhax has mirrored VX Heavens</a>. Due to persons such as Perforin, hh86, herm1t, DrWhax (motivated and excellent organizers) and many other contributors, the real original VXing has no chance to die! :-)<br><br><br>

In the experiments, he uses G2, viruses from SnakeBytes NGVCK, Z0MBie's ZPerm, Mental Drillers MetaPHOR and my Evolus/Flibi virus - for all of hem he gets very good results. The Flibi virus used in the experiments were a beta-version of <a href="ArtEvol.html">Evolus</a>, and in fact in the conversations with him I were able to improve the stealth technology (and I hope as well he got several ideas for improving his original concept).

</font><a name="18122011"></a><b>18.12.2011:</b><font size="2"> A very interesting paper has been released: <a href="EigenvirusesForMetamorphicVirusRecognition.pdf">Eigenviruses for metamorphic virus recognition</a> by M.E.Saleh, A.B.Mohamed and A.A.Nabi in <a href="http://digital-library.theiet.org/IET-IFS">IET Information Security</a>. The article covers the detection of metamorphic viruses using a novel and very intuitive methode called <em>Eigenvirus</em>. Eigenviruses are an analogon to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenface">Eigenfaces</a> for human face recognition. The main idea is to decompose viruses into a set of eigenvectors (called eigenviruses here). At detection, the principal components of the decomposition are compared with a prepared set of known generations of a virus. This is similar to a projection to a sub-vectorspace - the hypothesis of the paper is that for each generation of a specific metamorphic virus, this sub-vectorspace is similar, thus can be used for recognizion/detection. The authors prove their hypothesis by successfully detecting G2, NGVCK, Zperm and MetaPHOR very efficiently and with low false-positive.<br><br>
</font><a name="15122011"></a><b>15.12.2011:</b><font size="2"> Have been watching the trial of an austrian Bootkit writer <a href="http://www.stoned-vienna.com/">Peter Kleissner</a> today. He was accused of <a href="http://www.jusline.at/126c_Missbrauch_von_Computerprogrammen_oder_Zugangsdaten_StGB.html">&#167 126c StGB</a> - rawly translated "abuse of computer programms". This law also talks about the creation or adaptation of general malicous software - which was the case for Peter Kleissner, who created Stoned Bootkit, presented it at hacker conferences (BlackHat,...) and at his homepage. After 7-8h hearing, including two programmers from <a href="http://www.ikarus.at/en/">Ikarus</a>, the sentence was one of acquittal. The reason was (and this is interesting for any austrian malware author - I wonder if there is one?! :-) ) that software has to be predominantly created for malicous reasons, which was not the case for Peter. The public prosecutor immediatly declarated nullity, such that the case goes to court of next instance.

It is a very detailed - 10 pages (!) - analysis of the evolutionary metalanguage of the project. Peter Ferrie has used many clever/beautiful tricks to reduce the original instruction set (44 instructions) to an incredible compact set of 18+2 instructions, without the loss of functionality. I have already applied some of these tricks to the next generation of Evoris, and will analyse its effect on the overall robustness of the codes.

Detecting one part does not endanger the other one").<br>Both texts can be found in <a href="http://www.springer.com/computer/journal/11416">Journal in Computer Virology</a> or at <a href="http://vx.netlux.org/lib/pdf/">VX Heavens PDF page</a>.<br><br>F-Secure will co-operate a course about <a href="http://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/00002084.html">Malware Analysis and Antivirus Technologies</a> this year, the lecture notes will be presented <a href="https://noppa.tkk.fi/noppa/kurssi/t-110.6220/uutiset">here</a>, I guess that could be interesting.<br><br><br>

The only way to do this hobby effectivly is to spend much time for it - everything else is crap. As I have worked for about five years with computerviruses, I hope that other virus writers will continue our little subculture - hopefully somebody will continue our discoverments and techniques. Hopefully viruses with new techniques, for new platforms will be written. Hopefully people will continue working together in groups, release e-magazines with great content. Hopefully, everything last 20 years has been created will continue for many many years... Hopefully, somebody will create an artificial evolving beast, which can not be stopped. I've tried to help as much as I can, but this time is over now. Anyway - who knows - maybe one day: Second Part To Hell sedet ad dexteram Patris, et iterum venturus est cum gloria.<br><br>

I've tested the virus on 4 different OSes (WinXP, WinXP @ VMware, Win2000 and Win2003), and only one time it did not work. I'll fix this bug for the release of rRlf#7.<br><br>
</font><a name=04032006></a><b>04.03.2006:</b><font size="2"> Finally, my second running project has been finished. It is a binary InfoPath macro virus - the first virus which can infect <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_InfoPath" target="_blank">Microsoft Office Infopath</a> files. The source has more than 900 lines - and will be released in rRlf#7. You can download the <a href="iCab.rar">binary of InfoPath.iCab</a>. Now my primary artwork will be continued.<br><br>
</font><a name=27022006></a><b>27.02.2006:</b><font size="2"> I think I found out when the Winlogon DoS happens: When you use the debug.exe and give an input file; the input file contains a line, which's output should be quite big (i've done it with 100Bytes), WINLOGON.EXE starts using 100% of CPU-speed. If anybody else tests that, I would be happy to hear about the result.<br><br>
</font><a name=26022006></a><b>26.02.2006:</b><font size="2"> While trying to finish my second project, I've discovered a bug at a fully patched Windows XP SP2 - exactly a WINLOGON DoS. When you try to create a binary file via debug.exe, via a external file, and you write "e 0000 4D 5A 80 00 " (ect.), WINLOGON.EXE starts to use 100% of CPU-speed and the PC speaker starts to make very strange noise. This alone is not dangerous, but annoying, as you can not restart WINLOGON.exe. Maybe this could used for code injection or some other dangerous stuff too, I dont know so far (but I know that the created binary contains strange data). If you want a malicious dump file for testing that problem by yourself, send me an eMail. About my nearly finished second project: SlageHammer has helped me today very much, and now I know that it will be finished very soon (I think this week). So watch out for updates.<br><br>

I've deleted the "news" from 2005; you can see them on the bottom of the page at "archiv". I've also deleted the subpages BWG and JSG; the latest version of the program can be downloaded at subsite 'programs' now. I've made the page HTML 4.0 validated. And, the feature I'm most proud of: I've added RSS-Feeds :-). And now about viruses: I've started to code on my new project. This one has 13 parts, counted WITHOUT spreading-functionality. Five out of these 13 parts are very hard to code I think. Nevertheless, I've already finished the first small part. Next step: 2 more easy/small parts. Maybe I'll finish them this weekend - I can tell you, it was a nice feeling to use FASM again :-)<br><br>

What I can say is: It is highly polymorphic, EPO and ~ 2.500 lines Assembler. (source will be released in rRlf #7 - at 21.07.2006 - you can contribute to it by sending your stuff to <a href="mailto:DiA_hates_machine@gmx.de">DiA</a>). Now I will take a beer and then starting the project, which's idea I'm creating since automn. I've some brain-storming papers infront of me, showing the exactly structure of it.

Uhm, yes: I also thought that stop writing news at this homepage has no sense, so I do not do it...

</font><b>26.12.2005:</b><font size="2"> Real bad news today - REAL bad one: I've just talked to VirusBuster, and he made it true what he mentioned some weeks ago: <a href="http://vx.netlux.org/29a/" target="_blank">29A</a>#9 will not be released at 1.1.2006, and there is no other date for it (so far???). Reason: Too few contributes by 29a-members. So we can not do anything against it - even if many of us have tried it... As I wanted to contribute my two articles in that magazine, I've desided to send it to <a href="mailto:DiA_hates_machine@gmx.de">DiA</a> for <a href="http://www.rrlf.de.vu/" target="_blank">rRlf</a>#7.<br><br>

In case you know german, see <a href="http://www.dkriesel.com/content/studium/neuronetzefiles/neuronalenetze.pdf" target="_blank">this</a> article. It's really interesting, but hard to understand. The owner of that page, <a href="http://www.dkriesel.com/content/studium/frameset.htm" target="_blank">David Kriesel</a>, has several other related artikels about that topic on his page. Highly interesting topic, and maybe gives us some ideas for our future projects.<br><br>

</font><b>09.12.2005:</b><font size="2"> Sorry, but i think i have to give up writing viruses because I am fully stressed with <a href="http://www.viruslist.com/en/weblog?discuss=174904405&amp;return=1" target="_blank">playing computergames</a>... Well, of course, that was just a joke :-) Just wanted to comment on Eugene's stupid ideas of today's young persons! Recently I've found a very interesting computer language - highly complex, very useful for special virus technology (polymorphism, maybe even metamorphism, and who knows - maybe even good for AI), script and binary in one langauge. It has no connection to any other language I already know (and I know several languages +g+), and it is very new and will become quite popular. If you know what I mean, send me an e-Mail :-) I'll try to learn that language quite good (not just the roots of it) and do some stuff with it in the next future. More to come soon.<br><br>
</font><b>27.11.2005:</b><font size="2"> While reading the weblog at viruslist.com I got a strange idea for malware - no techniqual one, but maybe a good one anyway. The root: A malware program is detected by AVs when they get a sample of it. They have to analyse it and write a detection routine for it. This process uses (in a very good case) at least 10minutes. Now imagine: We would have a tool which morphes a .EXE file (maybe randomly [like the technique Code Evolution] or via packers/cryptors), that there is no connection between each file. It does not matter if the .EXE file still work or not. Now, our bad tool sends the morphed .EXE file to several email adresses like newvirus@kaspersky.com, peter_ferrie@hotmail.com, alexander.gostev@kaspersky.com (yes, to that n00b too :D) and eMail adresses of other AVers too. The Subject and the body has to be different, but with the same sense (like Subject: "newvirus", "maybe new malware", ect). The filename has to be different (taking a name from a file on the HD). When the tool sent the file, it morphes the .EXE again, and sends it again to several email adresses. What would happen? The analyser has to download the file, open it and analyse it for some time. Result: We waste the worthy time of our friends, and they have less time for working on real stuff. We could also use pseudo-beagle/sober/[insert virus here] body/subject. If they would ignore the incomming files, they will ignore real malware 100%, too. Somehow i have the feeling that this would make their work way harder :-) <br><br>
</font><b>24.11.2005:</b><font size="2"> Just finished an article called "Wikipedia: Using free knowlegde for bad stuff". It's about an idea how a computer virus could spread via wikipedia. The negative side-effect (and the reason why I've thought about deleting it again) is, that it's also very easy to destroy big parts of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/" target="_blank">free encyclopedia</a>. Even I've written it (i HAD TO write it) - i hope it never comes true or that all my positive test were not real!<br><br>

</font><b>24.10.2005:</b><font size="2"> Well, as you can see in last news, i did not code really much for the last 2-3 months, as i had some real life problem. The reason why I'm writing this now: All these problems are solved, and I feel free again - that feeling that makes you very motivated for fucking the world again :-) My to-do list is again growing (not because I'm lazy, but because I was again able to create new ideas and think about new techniques). I know i'm also going to code and write alot again. Often I read that phrase: "See you in better times" - I think that better times just started again...<br><br>

</font><b>02.07.2005:</b><font size="2"> I've just finished an article called "Monad: Microsoft Command Shell - Infection Tutorial". The article is about the infection of the new command shell of Microsoft Windows Longhorn (or Windows 2006 - if you prefer that). The first beta-version of that command-line has been released ~1 month ago - and there are already 5 viruses for it (overwriter, prepender, appender, EPO, cross infector). :D The article will be released in rRlf#6.<br><br>
</font><b>28.06.2005:</b><font size="2"> Due to several reasons the rRlf#6 release date is now the 21.07.2005.<br><br>
</font><b>07.06.2005:</b><font size="2"> Oh fuck, school sucks that much! Well, I've finished a project called "File Splitting Engine" and an article called "Surrealism in viruswriting: How to create new ideas". They will be released in rRlf#6.<br><br>
</font><b>27.05.2005:</b><font size="2"> I've finished my latest project, the "Code Evolution" idea. The result is a code named "Gloeobacter violaceus". It is neighter a real virus nor a real engine. I would descripe it as a (very?) primitive artificial life form. I tried to emulate nature's evolution with it - the rest is secret until rRlf#6 will be released. Now I'm trieng to bring the other idea to reality ("Overfile-Splitting") - hope I can finish it also that fast (<1 month) - but i dont really think so. Nevermind...<br><br>
</font><b>17.05.2005:</b><font size="2"> My current project is, as I've already thought, bringing the idea of "Code Evolution"-article (which you have not read so far as it's not released :D) to reality. I've already finished all mutation-functions, made a semi-good pseudo-RNG and so on. As blueowl helped me today with a stupid problem (thank you alot), I can continue now and maybe finish it all very soon. What needs alot of time is the testing of the mutated output, it's behaviour and opcode. But I really like it, it's fun to look at a program which morphs itself in a way you dont know. And you dont know if it works new generation, how it will behave... ;-) Wait for rRlf#6 to see it!<br><br>
</font><b>12.05.2005:</b><font size="2"> According to an AV-insider, many AVs have hard problems with a packer called <a href="http://www.anticracking.sk/">"SVK-Protector"</a>.

</font><b>11.05.2005:</b><font size="2"> I've written an very short article for LowLevel#8, called 'Einige Optimierungstricks'. It will be uploaded, when <a href="http://lowlevel.brainsware.org/">LowLevel #8</a> will be released.<br><br>
</font><b>09.05.2005:</b><font size="2"> After testing FireFox for some hours (I have not found any way to write to the HD), I became bored of JS. That was the reason to start by new project: Bringing the idea of Code Evolution-article to reality. I've already had some success (pseudo-RND, ect...), even this is my first real Win32 asm project. So far I have not got a name for the project, so if you have some nice ideas, write a mail to spth@priest.com. :-) I've also translated the interview with cyneox (about 2.000 words) to english that everyone can read it in rRlf#6. Ohhh, I wonder if ANYBODY reads this, as my counter says that last week there were zero (!!!) visitors +gg+. But maybe it's just a bug (at least I hope so, of course!).<br><br>
</font><b>30.04.2005:</b><font size="2"> I've finally finished the articel "New era of boosectorviruses #2: El Torito ISO infection at FAT32" (which will be released in rRlf#6), and withit I've finished my step into the OS and bootsector development (for now, maybe I'll return some day). I thought about a new project and two things came into my mind: Bringing the idea of 'Code Evolution' to reality. Second idea was, the day after the 50 milionth download of Firefox, searching for ways of spreading, connection of scripts and Firefox and related stuff. Unfortunatly time is very expensive currently, as I'm on the way to finish school next 2 months, but I'll try to invest as much as I can! After these two months I've alot of freetime (at least I hope so), which I'll definitivly use for coding again! :-) Anyway: I'll do whatever I can to produce high-quality (hehe) stuff!<br><br>

</font><b>12.04.2005:</b><font size="2"> First: Sorry for the long time of no news, but i had nothing important to say ;-) I've finally finished my SPTH-OS 2.0! It is the very first CD-ROM Bootsector infector. Unfortunatly the direcory changing does not work, but that does not matter alot, as this is just a prove-of-concept virus. You will find it in rRlf#6. I'm also going to write an article about FAT32 and ISO infection. Next project: I dont really know. Maybe bringing one of my two already-written-but-not-released-so-far ideas into reality or making a BOOTP virus (network-boot virus). Or maybe something totally different - who knows?! Something different: I've done a interview with SnakeByte for rRlf#6. I think it's quite interesting, so just wait for it.<br><br>
</font><b>21.03.2005:</b><font size="2"> After several hours of coding I finished a major step for my project: The virus is now able to search/infect files in all directories on the partition.

ISO format is much more difficult than IMG (of course), so it could use some more weeks (as i have alot to do for real life too currently). But dont worry, I'll finish that virus 100%! And it will be released in rRlf#6. Something else: I've read an EPOC virus article by Retro some days ago, which will be released in rRlf#6 too! The article is really great, I'm sure you will like it... If you want to contribute to our ezine, write a mail to <a href="mailto:DiA_hates_machine@gmx.de">DiA</a>!<br><br>
</font><b>27.02.2005:</b><font size="2"> I've written an interesting article called 'Code Evolution: Follow nature's example'. The article will be released in rRlf#6. My Project: I solved the next (and i hope last) major problem. I hope to release it soon.<br><br>
</font><b>20.02.2005:</b><font size="2"> I've done an interview with Cyneox about Linux Viruses for an 30 pages article for school. The interview is german, but highly interesting. It will be released in rRlf#6. Something else: My discoverment of FAT32 and the whole shit with it has been finished. It was really difficult to get real information about that. Well, now coding phase has been started. I've already had big success. If you don't know what I'm talking about: About a CD-ROM Bootsector virus. :-)<br><br>
</font><b>13.02.2005:</b><font size="2"> Finally, <a href="http://www.rrlf.de.vu">www.rrlf.de.vu</a> is uploaded. I need some more days to get access to upload. Anyway, it's in the net :).<br><br>
</font><b>09.02.2005:</b><font size="2"> As rrlf.host.sk is down now, we have desided to move our site to helith, as it's one of the last places where vxers can do what they want. We also made a redirection URL called http://www.rrlf.de.vu. This URL will stay our URL, even if we get kicked by hosts. Well, the site, as far as helith-network agree (we think so :D), will be uploaded as soon as possible.<br><br>
</font><b>01.02.2005:</b><font size="2"> I've finished an text called 'rRlf's bloody weekend', which will be released in rRlf#6. It's a text about the weekend, when philet0ast3r, DiA and rastafarie came to me. Currently rrlf.host.sk is down, for some days. I really hope it will return - we will wait for some more time, and if it don't return, we'll search a new host. I've also removed the old news from 2004. You can see a summary of the last year at the bottom of the page. I really had 100% no time for more coding last 1-2 weeks because this year I want to finish school=much to do. But I'll try to do my best as soon as possible.<br><br>
</font><b>25.01.2005:</b><font size="2"> This weekend philet0ast3r, DiA and rastafarie visited me for two days. It was totally cool, drunken, bloody, whatever - it was a great fun. You may see some pics and texts of it in rRlf#6.<br><br>
</font><b>16.01.2005:</b><font size="2"> Today I've finished an article called 'Over-File Splitting'. It's a new technique to fuck AVs. The article will be released in rRlf #6. And I've sent my unreleased article 'New era of bootsectorviruses #1: FAT12 IMG infection at Disks' and SPTH-OS 1.0 to <a href="mailto:lifewire@mail.ru">Lifewire</a> and they will be released iKx's xine #6.<br><br>
</font><b>08.01.2005:</b><font size="2"> Yesterday I've talked with Vorgon, and he told me that iKx finally wants to make/release xine#6. Well, that 'rumous' has often spread you may say. But this time I really think/hope that it's true. Vorgon and lifewire are both active, and a new member called 'ch4r_' joined recently. They started two weeks ago and want to release it in March 2005. I cross fingers for you! Something else: I've finally finished an article called 'New era of bootsectorviruses #1: FAT12 IMG infection at Disks'. The article is a full explanation of SPTH-OS 1.0 and also explaines all basic about that topic. #2 and maybe even #3 will also be written (i really hope soon), about improved techniques of that one. I dont know when they will be released, because I dont know where. But I try to do it as soon as possible!<br><br>
</font><b>04.01.2005:</b><font size="2"> Today I've finished the first version of my latest project: SPTH-OS 1.0. It's a bootsectorvirus, which infects the bootsector of FAT12 .IMG files in the Root_Directory of the current (infected) Disk. Executeable file uploaded (projects), source of this or a following version will be in rRlf#6! Of course, now let's go on with this project - 1.0 is just the very first finished version - more will come definitivly!<br><br>
</font><b>01.01.2005:</b><font size="2"> Again today: While checking out the 29a articles I was kind of shocked: I found an article called 'BOOT CD INFECTION' by a virus writer called LiTlLe VxW. LiTlLe VxW had 100% the same idea as me - writing a CD-ROM Boot infector. :-) Strange, hmm? (Just to make sure: He did not used any idea by me as I did not make it public [to avoid anybody writing the same as me :-D]) Now you also know what my latest project is. Ironically LiTlLe VxW has even sent 'thanks' to me in his article. (Answere: Yes, of course, it is nice :D) I could not find any virus for that so far, so LiTlLe VxW: Let's make a compedition, who can make the first CD Boot Infector? ;-) I've worked on that topic for quite long time (let's say, 2-3 month) and I've already had some success. As there was no contact: In case if you read this - please send me a mail!<br><br>
</font><b>01.01.2005:</b><font size="2"> Happy New Year! New year could not begin better: <a href="http://vx.netlux.org/29a/29a-8.rar">29A #8</a> has been released today (juppi!!! :D), and with it two articles by me: 'RUBY Virus Writing Guide' and 'Server -> Client Communication for Preprocessor languages (PHP)'. Therefore I've uploaded these two articles at my site. Something else: I've written an articles called 'FAT12 Dateizugriff' for the german online magzine <a href="http://lowlevel.brainsware.org/">LowLevel</a>. The article will be released in LowLevel#7.<br><br>
</font><b>21.12.2004:</b><font size="2"> I've uploaded Anti Virus for MenuetOS 1.1. Now the scanner also detects Menuet.Tristesse. It was not hard to code, but I nearly forgot about that program. Well, I did not have alot of time lately, therefore I have not continued my project. But as next week my holidays begin, I'll definitivly continue, and then I can also finally tell you, what my project is about. By the way: My two unreleased articles will be published in 29A#8 (I've asked VirusBuster and he said that they are accepted and will be published). Official release date should be 1st or 2nd january 2005.<br><br>
</font><b>15.12.2004:</b><font size="2"> I've collected alot of inforation about AVs and their bad behaviour, and I've written an text about that: <a href="kav.txt">How BigBrother wants to get us down!</a>. After reading you think different in some ways - I promise you! Please spread these infromations as hard as you can! Thank you!<br><br>
</font><b>12.12.2004:</b><font size="2"> The rumous that KAV has something to do with the latest 'actions' against virus writers is no more a rumous: It's true! Once Aleks Gostev (KAV) wrote a letter to netlux.org for shutting down vx.netlux.org (over the head of herm1t). But as herm1t belongs to the netlux-team, the letter has been sent to him immediately. Also recent actions against whale have been forced by I. Sumenko (virus analyst), S. Shevchenko (head of department of anti-virus research) and N. Kaspersky (CEO).<br><br>
</font><b>11.12.2004:</b><font size="2"> As host.sk is down again I had no homepage, but now, thanks to <a href="http://vx.netlux.org/">herm1t</a>, I have one again. If I would believe in god, i would say "God save you herm1t"! ;-) Much thanks for hosting me!!! I've found very first AV-report by Menuet.Tristesse. It's not very detailed, but it's true what the author (Crescencio Reyes) writes. The report can be found <a href="http://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/virusencyclo/default5.asp?VName=MENUETVIR">here</a>. Well done, Trend Micro! I'm currently working on something never seen and really interesting, but it will take much more time - it's a quite big project, which is totally secret so far! :-) News about will come soon! I've also remved most of the BWG and JSG versions, because the old once are really uninteresting.<br><br>
</font><b>30.11.2004:</b><font size="2"> <a href="http://www.viruslist.com/en/weblog">Viruslist: Benny, Ratter questioned</a>. I have talked to Benny about that statement, and he told me that he had NO connection with Slammer (so he will get no trouble - police got his software/hardware). And about Ratter, ValleZ and dis69 he said that he (and just he) had contact with police. Anyway, dis69 left <a href="http://29a.host.sk/">29A</a>. Well, the group is still active he said. Then, let's wait for first days in January 2005 for 29A#8! :-)<br><br>
</font><b>24.11.2004:</b><font size="2"> KAV detects RUBY.Paradoxon as Ruby.Pydoxon.a. It's the first Ruby virus in their database. And a very late av-name-news: BatXP.Nihilist will be detected as VirTool.Bat.Nihi.a. Nice! But they still don't detect Menuet/COM.Tristesse, even they have the binary and the explained source! Shame on you! Well, I've also uploaded a new picture by me as the old one has been done about 10 months ago. I hope you like it :-).<br><br>
</font><b>22.11.2004:</b><font size="2"> I have finished an article called 'Server -> Client Communication for Preprocessor Languages (PHP)'. Well, I think the title says everything. It will be released soon!<br><br>
</font><b>13.11.2004:</b><font size="2"> <a href="http://rrlf.host.sk/rrlf5.zip">rRlf #5</a> is out! Just download it, it's great! :-) Therefore I've uploaded 3 viruses and 4 articles. Just look at the subsites! Well, as KAV was not able to detect JS.Cassandra.b - or maybe they did, i don't care - wanted to uploaded version C, which spreads very fast! But I did not because of three reasons: 1.) I don't want to get troubles. 2.) I don't want anybody spreading a virus. 3.) I don't like JavaScript anymore, so coding it would be very boring. Sorry!<br><br>
</font><b>04.11.2004:</b><font size="2"> I've finished my latest project: The very first virus infecting Ruby-files. It's a prepender virus whithout a payload. I've sent the files to Kaspersky, looking for a new update with the virus 'Ruby.Paradoxon' :-). It will be released in rRlf#5. Now I'm going to write a tutorial and an advanced Ruby virus.<br><br>
</font><b>03.11.2004:</b><font size="2"> I've left my old host vx.helith.net, because many persons could not contact my site. Now i'm hosted by philet0ast3r's at host.sk. Much thanks to philet0ast3r for let me put my stuff at your domain, and thanks to vh for having hosted my for long time! Thank you!<br><br>
</font><b>01.11.2004:</b><font size="2"> I've added a new <a href="js.cassandra.b-col.zip">collection</a> of JS.cassandra.b. 21 generations (generation 1-21), because of <a href="mailto:alexander.gostev@kaspersky.com">Aleks Gostev</a>'s nice email ("Your crap dont work at 2nd generation"). I think this is a prove that you are false, my little friend! :-) I will upload JS.Cassandra.c at 13th november 2004, if KAV dont detect at least 99% of all generations (not just from that collection) until that date. The new version will contain mass-mail-routine, IRC-routine, P2P-routine, and will be at least as polymorph and encrypted as JS.Cassandra.b! A undetected (and maybe not real detectable) high-speed spreading worm. Just look at this site again in 2 weeks, and you will see what has changed :-)!<br><br>
</font><b>13.10.2004:</b><font size="2"> Today an article called 'Todeskusse' by Kathrin Wesely came out in the german magazine STERN extra (Campus & Karriere). It's mainly about DiA and me, and there is also a picture of each one. The article is quite good beside of one thing: I do NOT listen to the music the author wrote (If you want, look at 'contact' to find out the music I like)!<br><br>
</font><b>09.10.2004:</b><font size="2"> Yeahh, finally <a href="http://web105.essen082.server4free.de/lowlevel/doc/lowlevel-6.html">LowLevel#6</a> is out, and therefore I've uploaded 'Interview with Mike Hibbett' and 'MenuetOS - Der Weg zum Erfolg mit Assembler'. Have fun while reading, it's not virus related, anyway interesting I think.<br><br>
</font><b>07.10.2004:</b><font size="2"> Finally, after about 5 month, rRlf's new page (<a href="http://rrlf.host.sk/">rrlf.host.sk</a>) is up again. Just look at it!<br><br>
</font><b>06.10.2004:</b><font size="2"> <a href="http://www.dca-vx.go.ro/zine.html">DCA#1</a> is out. There are also some things by rRlf members (DiA, BlueOwl). So just get it. About rRlf: Philie has no time, and therefor he asked DiA, if he wants to be the new zine editor (he agreed) and me if i want to be the new webmaster (agreed too). Well, i haven't got the PWs so far, but as soon as I get it, I'll update the new site!<br><br>
</font><b>18.09.2004:</b><font size="2"> I wrote an article for the german OS-development magazine <a href="http://web105.essen082.server4free.de/lowlevel/doc/index.html">LowLevel</a> called 'MenuetOS - Der Weg zum Erfolg mit Assembler'. The article contains some general parts from my 'MenuetOS infection' article, but also a coding example. The article doesn't contain any virus-related infos, just coding examples and infos. It will be released in LowLevel#6, and I hope the magazine is out soon. Currently I'm working on my probalby last MenuetOS virus, a very advanced one, and I've also discover some new parts of Menuet, as last version (0.78pre3) isn't that virus-friendly as other versions were. So much work again. Something very important: You know that www.rrlf.de belongs no more to us, as the provider kicked us (now it contains a nice sex-page :D), but philie registered <a href="http://rrlf.host.sk/">rrlf.host.sk</a>, and it's up now! Just visit it!!!<br><br>
</font><b>08.09.2004:</b><font size="2"> Great news today: I've finished my latest project: Menuet/COM.Tristesse, a multi-platform infector. Tristesse infects COM files via appending and MENUET files via prepending. The biggest problem while coding was, that MenuetOS is a 32bit based OS, and COM files uses 16bits. Well, the virus will be released soon.<br><br>
</font><b>04.09.2004:</b><font size="2"> My old host (www.bigsitecity.com) deleted my page, so I had to search a new host, and came back to Van Helsing. Thanks guy! Another thing: I finished an article called 'Code via Behaviour', and it will be released soon I hope.<br><br>
</font><b>17.08.2004:</b><font size="2"> Three news today: Firstly, I wrote a text called 'The weekend of rRlf meeting', which is, as you can see on the name, about the weekend when I met PhileT0ast3r, DiA and the other guys/girls. The text will be released in rRlf#5 and rumous tells that PhileT0ast3r will also write such a text and release it in rRlf#5 :-). And secondly: I've coded an Anti Virus Program for MenuetOS, which is available with source in sub-site 'programs'. It may also be included to the official Menuet-disk, depends on what Mike Hibbett thinks. And last thing: KAV detects my 'Menuet.Oxymoron' as 'Menuet.Xymo.a', but they just detect it at one static offset, so most infected files aren't detected. Well done, guys. :D Maybe you should install the OS at least one time and test it!<br><br>
</font><b>10.08.2004:</b><font size="2"> Maybe you noticed, but www.rrlf.de has been down for some days. Today philie told me the reason: The provider kicked www.rrlf.de due to illegal content! Now philie registered rrlf.host.sk, and it will be up very soon!<br><br>
</font><b>09.08.2004:</b><font size="2"> I interviewed Mike Hibbett, the new main-coder of <a href="http://www.menuetos.org">MenuetOS</a> for the german online-magazine <a href="http://web105.essen082.server4free.de/lowlevel/doc/index.html">LowLevel</a>. The interview will be released in issue #6!<br><br>
</font><b>02.08.2004:</b><font size="2"> That weekend I met PhileT0ast3r/rRlf with his girlfriend (3 days), Disk0rdia/rRlf (very short), dr.g0nZo/rRlf with his girlfriend (short) and DiA/rRlf (some hours) in real life. It was totally funny, and I was most time very drunken as we started our days with a 80% KORN! ;-)<br><br>
</font><b>18.07.2004:</b><font size="2"> Today, while checking out <a href="http://www.viruslist.com">KAV's site</a> I had to look twice: <a href="http://29a.host.sk">29a</a> has finished three great new proof-of-concept viruses: <a href="http://www.viruslist.com/eng/viruslist.html?id=1580242">Win64.Rugrat.a</a> by roy g biv,  <a href="http://www.viruslist.com/eng/viruslist.html?id=1689517">Worm.SymbOS.Cabir.a</a> by vallez and <a href="http://www.viruslist.com/eng/viruslist.html?id=1874404">WinCE.Duts.a</a> by Ratter! Damn, these guys are great and I'm looking forward to 31.12.2004/1.1.2005 for 29a#8!<br><br>
</font><b>16.07.2004:</b><font size="2"> I'm sorry to bother you again today ;-), but I've a news: <a href="http://www.blackhatbook.com">John Biggs</a> released a book and I was interviewed for that. In the book there is also a screen-shot of my BWG and the full code of PHP.RainBow with a nice explanation. It's about all kinds of the underground (hackers, crackers, phreakers, virus writers, spammers, ...)<br><br>
</font><b>16.07.2004:</b><font size="2"> I added some links to AV reports of my viruses and changed some links. Currently I'm working on a real new Menuet-virus, which will be good i think ;-)! About rRlf-page: It's not updated for more than two month, but don't worry: Philie is still alive, he's just damn busy!<br><br>
</font><b>29.06.2004:</b><font size="2"> Finally, today I finished my latest article: MenuetOS infection. As it's a very long and detailt article, I'm very proud that I could show it to you soon. This article will also be released in rRlf#5. Another thing: KAV released a new update, and in it a virus called 'Menuet.Xymo.a'. I really hope that you will write a report about it. :-) My next project is, of course find some other secrets in that OS. That means: much work again. <br><br>
</font><b>24.06.2004:</b><font size="2"> Again today: As I thought that I should release the executeable of my new virus, I did it (in 'project'-subsite)... Source will follow in rRlf#5!<br><br>
</font><b>24.06.2004:</b><font size="2"> A big news: I finished my MenuetOS virus, which is the world's very first one, and it's called Menuet.Oxymoron. I sent the executeable to some AV-reasearchers, and the source will be released in rRlf#5. Now I start to write an article about MenuetOS viruses. News about that will come soon...<br><br>
</font><b>07.06.2004:</b><font size="2"> Today I found something really interesting while searching with google: www2.coderz.net is still/again available. That means, that also some VX-homepages are available. :-) Now I want to say sorry not updating my page recently, but I haven't finished anything new, but nearly... Just wait for rRlf#5! And last thing: You can contribute to 29a#8 now, just contact VirusBuster!<br><br>
</font><b>20.05.2004:</b><font size="2"> Being a little bit scared about Van Helsing, I got my old host. Today I read a very strange article about him, telling that he could be a very bad guy :D.<br><br>
</font><b>19.05.2004:</b><font size="2"> Maybe you have already found out: I have a new Host... <a href="http://vx.helith.net/">Van Helsing</a> hosts me for about one week and everything works great so far. Much thanks, guy.<br><br>
</font><b>28.04.2004:</b><font size="2"> DvL released <a href="http://www.geocities.com/batchlab/bz5.zip">Batch Zone #5</a>, and therefor I added an article called 'Past, Present and Future of Batch' and uploaded BatXP.Nihilist, which is the first Batch EPO virus.<br><br>
</font><b>22.04.2004:</b><font size="2"> Today's night I found a great WinXP command. It's called <b>lsadump2.exe</b>. Inputing that filename to cmd.exe, you will get some strange values, which I haven't foudn out what they are. But one of these value if the Password of the Local User. I have tested it on Windows XP Home Edition with FAT32 and it works. It dont work on NTFS-formated hard disk, and it also don't exist on WinXP Professional. Anyways, it is really great, and I have already collected seven Password so far :-)<br><br>
</font><b>19.04.2004:</b><font size="2"> I changed my web-host now, because geocities.com sucks! Much thanks goes to <a href="http://www.bigsitecity.com">bigsitecity.com</a>! I hope this one is ok now!<br><br>
</font><b>16.04.2004:</b><font size="2"> I had some problems with my host, but it seems everything is ok again. I haven't finished upload the site so far, but I'll do it as soon as possible.<br><br>
</font><b>12.04.2004:</b><font size="2"> GoodWeekend, The Sydney Morning Harald Magazine's weekend special released Clive Thompson's article again, and I'm on the cover of it. Beside of media-shit i improved the site: I rewrote links-sub-site, and now every link work and I added some other links and I added information about a finished virus at sub-site 'projects'.<br><br>
</font><b>28.03.2004:</b><font size="2"> Two days ago an article in the german weekly magazine "Die Zeit" called "Infiziert" by Sabine Magerl came out. The Article is mainly about PhileT0ast3r and me, and there are also pictures in it. you can find the article <a href="http://www.zeit.de/2004/14/Virenw_9frmer">here</a>. And last week there was a translated and shorted version of Clive Thompson's virus article in the german weekly magazine "<a href="http://www.weltwoche.ch/artikel/?AssetID=7248&amp;CategoryID=60">WeltWoche</a>". <br><br>
</font><b>19.03.2004:</b><font size="2"> It's my birthday today and I'm 2 years in the virus-writing scene. Many things happened the last year.... I wanted to upload a gift for you (Cipher Text Generator), but i wasn't able to finish it. So you have to wait some days/weeks... <br><br>
</font><b>09.03.2004:</b><font size="2"> I have a new email address: <a href="mailto:spth@priest.com">spth@priest.com</a>. Every mail you sent last few days, please send it again, because the old one didn't work.<br><br>
</font><b>07.03.2004:</b><font size="2"> I uploaded a picture of myself, because the other one sucked :-). You can find it in sub-site 'contact'...<br><br>
</font><b>04.03.2004:</b><font size="2"> As KAV still don't detect my JS.Cassandra.b and <a href="mailto:alexander.gostev@kaspersky.com">Alexander Gostev</a> (a KAV researcher) making jokes about it, I decided to upload a collection of different generation of the virus. You can find it <a href="js.cassandra.b-col.zip">here</a>. I'm still discovering the MenuteOS Kernel and i've already found some very interesting things. You just have to wait some time...<br><br>
</font><b>01.03.2004:</b><font size="2"> <a href="http://29a.host.sk/">29A issue #7</a> came out and with it an article by me called 'PHP Virus Writing Guide'. So I added this article. In the eZine there is a letter by Benny, who wrote that he leaves the virus-writing scene due to some reasons. One of the reasons is darkman's (a.k.a. johnlw) behavior in IRC #virus. He banned several people who are in the New York Times Magazine article like Benny, Vorgon, PhileT0ast3r and me. I don't want to write my opinion of that act here. Another news: <a href="http://vx.netlux.org">vx.netlux.org</a> is up again, but as it seems, no more a host for VX sites.<br><br>
</font><b>26.02.2004:</b><font size="2"> I added JSG 1.16, because KAV added a very lame detection routine, so I also encrypted the standart code and fixed 8 bugs. To Alex: Try to work more on the Crypt.JSG, not on a standart-detetion because i can change the standart-code every time, and you can't rest in peace! :-)<br><br>
</font><b>18.02.2004:</b><font size="2"> I found my source of JSG again, and so I finished the latest version and released it: Added dIRC/Xircon- Hard ay/Xircon - (More) Silence Way spreading, Added an extern encryption and improved the stardart encryption very much. And <a href="http://www.geocities.com/batch_zone/bz4.zip"> Batch Zone #4</a> is released.<br><br>
</font><b>17.02.2004:</b><font size="2"> Gigabyte was arrested due to the fact, that she is virus writer. Now also coderz.net is down, which was a host for about 20 virus writer's homepages. Read the full article <a href="http://antivirus.about.com/b/a/2004_02_13.htm">here</a>. And now something much better: 29A magazine #7 will be released at 28th february 2004! And FormatC magazine #1 will be released at the beginning of March 2004. Let's hope that they will be good :-)<br><br>
</font><b>08.02.2004:</b><font size="2"> Today The New York Times Magazine released an article by Clive Thompson called '<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/08/magazine/08WORMS.html">The Virus Underground</a>'. It's really interesting, so go and read it. (I also became interviewed for the article in real life)<br><br>
</font><b>03.02.2004:</b><font size="2"> KAV improved the detection of PHP.RainBow. Now they detect ~68%. Sorry, but that's not really enougth. :-) JS.Cassandra.a/b are still nearly undetect (that means up to generaton 3 there is nothing detect). Damn, what's up with you KAV? Well, you really increased the PHP.RaBow detection with 1200%, but that's still not enougth. And JS.Cassandra.a/b are more or less undetected (for a few month)...<br><br>
</font><b>26.01.2004:</b><font size="2"> Added the second version of JS.Cassandra, which is definitivly my last script-virus. Well, JS.Cassandra.b is a 5-times polymorph, sometimes encrypt and very complex JS-virus. I wish the AVs much fun with detecting this virus! :-)<br><br>
</font><b>14.01.2004:</b><font size="2"> I added a new article I made last 2 month. It's name is 'New IRC spreading' and it's about 2 new IRC-programs, which you can use to spread your worms.<br><br>
</font><b>13.01.2004:</b><font size="2"> I removed the news from the year 2003. Now you can see them in the archiv, where you can also find a shourt resume of that year.<br><br>
</font><b>06.01.2004:</b><font size="2"> New year begins with a very good news: It seems, some vx-people are still very interested. First thing is, that a group called BlackGate have a <a href="http://blackgate.us/">forum</a> where everybody can discuss about VX related topics and new techniques and whatever. Second cool thing is, that <a href="http://the-formatc.org/">formatC</a> (a group founded by Knowdeth) has a homepage and also hosts VX-sites. They also want to release a eZine with old 16-bit asm stuff (Back to the roots!). Well, let's hope that you can read more good news soon. Another thing: I added a motto at my homepage. Even this sentence is very old (middle of 70s), it's very good for our time: "Let the bells of freedom ring!" (Magician's Birthday by Uriah Heep)...<br><br>
</font><b>24.12.2003:</b><font size="2"> Well, Kaspersky worked hard and tried to detect my viruses. Result of the hard work: JS.Cassandra (1.300 Files tested): 2nd Generation-Detection: ~5,8% | 3rd Generation-Detection: ~0%, PHP.RainBow (100 Files tested): 2nd Generation-Detection: ~5%! :D Well, I hope they haven't stopped to work on these problems.<br><br>
</font><b>23.12.2003:</b><font size="2"> AArrrggghh... I hate christmas! Why I tell you this? well, just for fun :-)! OK, a little news: I met Arzy in real life at 20th december and another guy, but so far I won't tell you who it is. You will see in January 2004 :-).<br><br>
</font><b>11.12.2003:</b><font size="2"> Added a small article about a problem with WindowsXP's NotePad (Microsoft Editor Version 5.1).<br><br>
</font><b>06.12.2003:</b><font size="2"> As I said, <a href="http://www.rrlf.de/rrlf4.zip">rRlf#4</a> is out since today. Therefore I uploaded five viruses (PHP.RainBow, JS.Cassandra, JS.Sinope, BatXP.Palindrom.b, HTML.Umbriel) and 4 articles (Exotic Morphing Techniques In JavaScript, Polymorphism in JavaScript, Cross Infection in JavaScript, Useful things in JavaScript). Well, these are the things I did last few month. I hope you like it!<br><br>
</font><b>01.12.2003:</b><font size="2"> Well, I've a news for you: rRlf #4 will be released at 6.12.2003 if everything works as it should work. I've already seen a member pre-view version and it's cool. OK, I also uploaded a new pic by me, since the other one is about 1 year old and now i'm looking little different (of course: I have long hairs now :D).<br><br>
</font><b>20.11.2003:</b><font size="2"> BATch Zone #3 is out since today, and available <a href="http://www.geocities.com/ratty_dvl/BATch/bz3.zip">here</a>. Therefor I also uploaded a virus called BAT.Lorelei.<br><br>
</font><b>16.11.2003:</b><font size="2"> Maybe you know it, but vx.netlux.org is down. I wrote some mails to herm1t, but haven't got an answere (so far??). Therefor I have a new host. I hope, herm1t's page will be up again, since he's one of the few sites, who's osting vx-related stuff. <br><br>
</font><b>17.10.2003:</b><font size="2"> From Vorgon's site: "IKX Xine #6 in the works! Its been a long time since we released our last xine, but now were pulling together to release the best issue yet. Were looking for contributions from experienced vxers. Show us your lastest virii, worms, tuts and articles. Send all contributions to: vorgon_ikx@programmer.net.". Hope you have success :-)<br><br>
</font><b>05.10.2003:</b><font size="2"> OK, Whackerz ezine #1 is out, and because of PakBrain's problems with his host, available <a href="whackerz1.zip">here</a>. Go and get it!<br><br>
</font><b>01.10.2003:</b><font size="2"> First I want to say sorry for the long time of no news. OK, let's start: I found out, that KAV isn't able to detect the overwriter generated by my  'Simple Win32ASM Overwriter Generator', which I uploaded 3 month ago, and they also don't detect any output of my 'Random Silly Batch Generator', which became released 2,5 month ago. Seems they gave up the game... :D! Something else: rRlf#4 will be out soon, so if you want to contribute something useful go and drop <a href="mailto:philet0ast3r@rRlf.de">phileT0ast3r</a> a mail. Maybe you wonder, why I haven't uploaded anything recently, but my things will be released in zines, and these zines aren't out so far, as you may know. OK, what I'm doing now: I'm working on some cool JavaScript techniques and on some ideas jackie gave me. Thanks again! :-)<br><br>
</font><b>09.09.2003:</b><font size="2"> As you know, I had to pass two exams these days, I have the resuls: I passed both, and now I'm really back, less quantity but more quality! :-) OK, I also uploaded an email by a TV security specialist, who tried to explain, why we talked shit. If you're bored, read it! It's a german text.<br><br>
</font><b>06.09.2003:</b><font size="2"> A pure VX news again (I hope, somebody likes to read that, if not: mail me :D ): CoKe, member of the old and well-known VX group VLAD (dead), came back to the VX-scene again after a 8-year-pause. He said, that he wants to write viruses again and maybe reactiv VLAD again! Anyway, I wish you much success with your future projects!<br><br>
</font><b>05.09.2003:</b><font size="2"> A pure VX news today: Yesterday I had a talk with Knowdeth, and it seems like Metaphase is dead, because most of the members were really lazy. And as you know, they wanted to release Metaphase#3, the zine will probably never released. But now some guys reactived <a href="http://vx.netlux.org/~slam/">SLAM</a> virus group, with new members (CyberYoda, veedee, Jackie, Lys Kovick and Knowdeth [hope I didn't forget anybody]), and they want to release SLAM#5. To contribute the zine, give CyberYode a mail, due he's the editor.<br><br>
</font><b>16.08.2003:</b><font size="2"> I didn't upload anything this time, but I have a great news: AlcoPaul is back in the scene, and because of that, Brigada Ocho is also back! Now they are planning Brigada Ocho Zine #3. If you want to contribute, write an <a href="mailto:brigadaocho@digitelone.com">e-mail</a>. Also <a href="http://www.geocities.com/ratty_dvl/BATch/main.htm"> DvL </a> wants to release the <a href="http://www.geocities.com/ratty_dvl/BATch/main_files/bz.htm">BATch zine #3</a>. If you want to contribute him any batch stuff, drop him a <a href="mailto:dvl2003ro@yahoo.co.uk">mail</a>. Now about my site: I added some project-infos.<br><br>
</font><b>20.07.2003:</b><font size="2"> <a href="http://www.velasco.com.br/"> Marcos Velasco </a> made a program called 'Anti-BAT', and I guess it's the very best Batch detection tool ever. You will find the program <a href="http://www.velasco.com.br/projetos.htm"> here</a>.<br><br>
</font><b>17.07.2003:</b><font size="2"> DvL released his <a href="http://www.geocities.com/ratty_dvl/BATch/main_files/bz2.zip"> BATch Zine #2</a>. It contains one generator named 'Random Silly Batch Generator' and the 'Bat|BatXP.Iaafe', which I did together with philet0ast3r. Because of that I also uploaded these things at my homepage. <br><br>
</font><b>02.07.2003:</b><font size="2"> There is a big problem, and I think, you should know it: I missed two subjects in school and i have to learn in holidays (next nine weeks). Maybe I'll do nothing next time. If I'll pass the exams in sebtember, I'll be back, else it could be that I'll be away forever. Chance is 50/50! I hope, that you understand my oppinion. Let's see, what future brings. <br><br>
</font><b>30.06.2003:</b><font size="2"> I added the 'Simple Win32ASM Overwriter Generator'. Philet0ast3r and me thought, that it should not be in rRlf #4. Anybody sent the beta-version of the tool to KAV, but this is the real version. Currently the viruses aren't detect (and I hope, they will not be detect for long time :p). Something else: I deleted most of my viruses at the page just because of one reason: the are lame. In future I'll just upload viruses with some special features.<br><br>
</font><b>14.06.2003:</b><font size="2"> In the Virus Bulletin of June 2003 is a article about one of my BWG-worms. The reason is, that this BAT.BWG.a@mm use the EICAR-file to avoid AV detection, and it seems, much AVs have problems with that. Therefore the definition of the EICAR-testfile became changed. I think, that's one of the biggest success of a batch-malware ever :-). More infos <a href="http://www.virusbtn.com/magazine/archives/200306/"> here</a>. Special Thanks goes once more to <a href="http://www.virustrading.com/doctorrave/"> Doctor Rave</a> for giving me the idea.<br><br>
</font><b>09.06.2003:</b><font size="2"> Yesterday DvL released his zine. Download it <a href="http://www.geocities.com/ratty_dvl/BATch/main_files/bz1.zip"> here</a>. Because of that I added my second Interview, the Batch Encrypter 2.0 and one Batch Article. Somthing else: About 1h ago Philet0ast3r and Disk0rdia left. It was a genial time :-)<br><br>
</font><b>08.06.2003:</b><font size="2"> Yesterday PhileT0ast3r and Disk0rdia arrived at my house! wow, i was so drunken and stoned yesterday. Because of that don't wait for some breaking new things from me in the next days :-) <br><br>
</font><b>26.05.2003:</b><font size="2"> <a href="mailto:dvl2003ro@yahoo.co.uk">DvL</a> wants to release a Batch-only zine. If you want to contribute, please write him a mail. <br><br>
</font><b>25.05.2003:</b><font size="2"> Added Batch Encrypter version 1.3. (Added trash including).<br><br>
</font><b>25.05.2003:</b><font size="2"> I finished the the changed at site "viriis", "projects" and "programs". Now there are (better) explanation of the things.<br><br>
</font><b>19.05.2003:</b><font size="2"> Today I got a mail by Kefi telling me, that a person named <a href="http://trax.to/sevenC"> SevenC </a> ripped my whole BWG! He haven't changed anything in he code, just the infos are changed. Also KAV detect it as Constructor.BAT.BWG.501, and the output is detect as I-Worm.BWG.d. You will find it <a href="BWGripped.zip"> here</a>. Thanks lamer!<br><br>
</font><b>14.05.2003:</b><font size="2"> Maybe you saw it: I removed sub-site "bombs" and added "projects". Here you'll find all no released or not finished viruses.<br><br>
</font><b>11.05.2003:</b><font size="2"> <a href="http://www2.coderz.net/coderz3.zip">coderz.net#3</a> is out, and there are some things from me. I also uploaded them at my page: "How To Crypt JavaScript" and "Polymorphism in BatXP".<br><br>
</font><b>22.04.2003:</b><font size="2"> I fixed a totally silly and little bug in the JSG 1.14: Upoaded the JavaScriptGenerator 1.14 (fixed) <br><br>
</font><b>21.04.2003:</b><font size="2"> I added a new JavaScriptGenerator: version 1.14: It's able to overwrite the autorun.inf, deleting AV programs and better encryption.<br><br>
</font><b>21.04.2003:</b><font size="2"> Maybe you want it, maybe not: The password of the old JavaScript-Generator sources. It's <i> dnoces </i>!<br><br>
</font><b>11.04.2003:</b><font size="2"> JavaScriptGenerator 1.13: I made the whole fake-variable parts new, and now they are much more variable, I think. And as you can see, I didn't added any new freature. If you know something useful to add in next version, please send me an eMail! Much Thanks!!<br><br>
</font><b>10.04.2003:</b><font size="2"> Uploaded JSG 1.12! No new freatures, just killed KAV alarm! But you can expect something new in the next version!<br><br>
</font><b>06.04.2003:</b><font size="2"> I made a new Win32 asm virus: Win32.Supertoys. It's another overwriter, which infects EXE, PIF, SCR, BAT, CMD and COM files!<br><br>
</font><b>05.04.2003:</b><font size="2"> rRlf makes a contest (A polymorphic Bat and BatXP virus with 5.5KB). More information <a href="http://www.rrlf.de/countertest.html"> here </a>.<br><br>
</font><b>05.04.2003:</b><font size="2"> Added the binary of Win32.Mood because I got about 15 mail asking for the Binary!<br><br>
</font><b>03.04.2003:</b><font size="2"> Uploaded the JavaScript Generator version 1.11. Killed the "JS.Spthgen" by KAV. It was very easy, because the detection routine is very lame. I hope, they will work harder this days. Otherwise I've to think, that they loose the game "JSG versus KAV"! ;-) <br><br>
</font><b>01.04.2003:</b><font size="2"> Added a Win32asm Virus: Win32.Mood &lt;-- Infecting EXE by overwriting, hooks BAT, CMD, JS, VBS and HTM <br><br>
</font><b>27.03.2003:</b><font size="2"> I uploaded another polymorphic BatXP virus: BatXP.Palindrom! It's changing its encryption variables. And with this virus I'm leaving the land of batch-malware! <br><br>
</font><b>19.03.2003:</b><font size="2"> Today I've birthday: I'm 16! ;-) An other thing: I have been one full year in scene. Now: Let's have a party... <br><br>

</font><b>27.02.2003:</b><font size="2"> I added a string-encrypter. you can use it to encrypt your secret messages. Don't know, if it have some sence, but I think, it's cool ;-)<br><br>
</font><b>27.02.2003:</b><font size="2"> KAV detected the viriis from JSG! now it's a much better encryption: JSG 1.07 <br><br>
