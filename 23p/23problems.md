# 23 Open Problems for Digital Self-Replicators
## by Second Part To Hell

*Who of us would not be glad to lift the veil behind which the future lies
hidden; to cast a glance at the next advances of our field and at the secrets of
its development during future centuries? What particular goals will there be
toward which the leading pioneers of digital self-replicators of coming
generations will strive? What new methods and new facts in the wide and rich
field of intelligent artificial self-replicators will the future bring to light?*
 
These words are inspired by the introductory remarks of [David Hilbert's speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_problems),
delivered at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris in 1900. He
proceeded to introduce 23 open mathematical challenges, which profoundly
influenced mathematical research throughout the 20th century.
 
Today, I take the opportunity to present a compilation of 23 crucial challenges
in the realm of digital self-replicators, computer viruses, and worms. I find
each of these challenges deeply fascinating. Their underlying motivations,
background, and preliminary pathways toward resolution are detailed herein,
along with my view of their potential (or partial) solutions.
 
With this list, I aim to inspire the upcoming generation of programmers. Those
of you passionate about artificial intelligence, evolution, and the essence of
life should dive deep into these significant challenges. I truly believe that
solving these problems will make a lasting difference.

|--------|--------------|-------------------|-----------------|--------------------|
| 1 | **Metamorphism and Advanced Mutation Techniques** | <details><summary>**Strong Metamorphism and Macro-Mutations via Large Language Models**</summary>The rise of publicly accessible, advanced AI models like GPT has not only astounded many but has also ushered in novel mutation techniques for viruses. Rather than crafting our own mutation engines, such as metamorphic engines, viruses can now directly request tools like GPT to produce new code and functionalities for their succeeding iterations via their APIs. I showcased this capability for the first time in March 2023 [1]. However, these initial codes merely scratch the surface. Due to the constraints of the foundational GPT model, such as text-davinci003, there's an inherent limitation to the code's variability. I went a step further in LLMorpher3, where also prompts are generated by GPT -- using GPT4. But the system was still extremely brittle and at no way at a level of hand-crafted metamorphism engines[2].<br><br>This brings us to an intriguing question: How can artificial self-replicators leverage LLMs to achieve metamorphism on par with powerful metamorphic viruses like Win.MetaPHOR [3] or JS.Transcriptase [4]? Can we move past micro-mutations and pioneer macro-mutators, which can transform extensive logic blocks, not just code snippets [5]? Where do we draw the line?<br><br>With tools like Github Copilot excelling in macro-logic coding tasks, it's imperative to explore their potential for virus metamorphism.<br><br>[1] SPTH, "Using GPT to encode and mutate computer viruses entirely in natural language ", [link](https://github.com/SPTHvx/SPTH/blob/master/articles/files/LLMorpher.txt), 2023.<br>[2] SPTH, "Full Metamorphism of computer virus code and prompts via GPT4", [link](https://github.com/SPTHvx/SPTH/blob/master/articles/files/LLMorpher.txt), 2023.<br>[3] Mental Driller, "Metamorphism in practice", 29a#6, 2002.<br>[4] SPTH, "Metamorphism and Self-Compilation in JavaScript", valhalla#3, 2012.<br>[5] herm1t, "Recompiling the Metamorphism", valhalla#2, 2012.</details> | **Partial Solution:** High metamorphism surpassing MetaPHOR/Transcriptase.<br>**Full Solution:** Macro-level mutators. | unsolved |
| 2 | **Metamorphism and Advanced Mutation Techniques** | <details><summary>**Metamorphism as a Deep Reinforcement Learning problem**</summary>DeepMind showcased how a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent could unearth new and efficient sorting methods. These have even been adopted into the standard C++ sort library of LLVM [1]. They set up the sorting task like a game, where rewards are sparse, and had their agent, AlphaDev, learn it. Imagine applying a similar approach to discovering fresh code versions for self-replicators. This could open doors to mutations beyond a programmer's wildest imagination. There are, of course, questions about resources, but we'll address that later.<br><br>[1] DeepMind, "Faster sorting algorithms discovered using deep reinforcement learning", Nature, 2023.</details> | **Solution:** Deep Reinforcement Learning agent for discovering new mutations. | unsolved |
| 3 | **Metamorphism and Advanced Mutation Techniques** | <details><summary>**Highly expressive mutation engines inspired by natural evolution**</summary>Metamorphic engines can reshape code in countless ways. But if we consider the entire universe of possible code structures, these engines barely scratch the surface. It's a double-edged sword: while we want self-replicators to retain their essential functions (including spreading), this restraint also leaves a vast world of potential unexplored.<br><br>Nature offers inspiration here. From single-cell bacteria evolving into intricate systems like meat-eating plants or intelligent beings such as cats, all came about due to random mutations and natural selection. No matter how sophisticated a coded mutation engine might be, it's unlikely to replicate the profound changes we see in nature's DNA blueprint. Note that we are not talking about evolutionary optimization algorithms (such as used in W32.Zellome [1]), we seek something more extreme.<br><br>Purely random mutations might not be the perfect fit for digital evolution because of their inherent instability. With nature as a guide, scientists have created stable digital evolutionary systems. Thomas S. Ray's work [2,3] introduced an "artificial chemistry"â€”a set of clear instructions capable of assembling self-replicators that fight for limited resources in a virtual environment. His creation, the Tierra system, had a sturdy language that minimized mutation's adverse effects. This foundation allowed more mutations to stack up, resulting in novel behaviors, like digital parasites. Others, like Christoph Adami, expanded on this with advanced simulators [4,5].<br><br>Yet, these digital entities remain confined within their virtual world. Around 2010-2011, I ventured to bring them to life in real-world systems, guided by Ray's vision of a resilient evolutionary language. The resulting entities, Evoris and Evolus, could navigate native win32 environments [6,7], and their nature was deeply examined by Peter Ferrie [8-10].<br><br>Despite their potential to explore beyond conventional metamorphic engines, Evoris and Evolus are fragile and rely heavily on their in-built mutation engine. It remains a challenge to transfer the principles from biological evolution and Ray's 30-year-old virtual-world adaptations to self-replicators in real-world OSs like Windows or Linux. One possible path? Simulators that test millions of mutation variations and choose the fittest for reproduction.<br><br>[1] Peter Ferrie, "It's zell(d)ome the one you expect", Virus Bulletin, May 2005.<br>[2] Tom S.

| 4 | **Metamorphism and Advanced Mutation Techniques** | <details><summary>**Auto-generated mutation engines via Large Language Models**</summary>My LLMorpher research showcased the capability of a self-replicator to leverage GPT for evolving its code, albeit with a constant need for OpenAI access [1]. An intriguing alternative would be harnessing GPT temporarily to devise independent mutation engines. These engines, once crafted, would then operate autonomously in the future generations of the self-replicator, eliminating the need for consistent access to the LLM. I've observed even GPT 3.5 can craft basic mutation functionalities, and I anticipate future LLMs to be exponentially proficient in this regard. The challenge lies in seamlessly integrating these auto-generated engines into subsequent generations of the self-replicator.<br><br>[1] SPTH, "Using GPT to encode and mutate computer viruses entirely in natural language", [link](https://github.com/SPTHvx/SPTH/blob/master/articles/files/LLMorpher.txt), 2023.</details> | **Solution:** Self-replicator deriving new mutation engines from LLMs. | unsolved |
| 5 | **Metamorphism and Advanced Mutation Techniques** | <details><summary>**Exploring the power of Linguisto-Morphism**</summary>In my LLMorpher research, I illustrated the capability to encode computer codes into natural language. These textual representations were then interpreted and transformed back into executable code by GPT. Advancing this approach in LLMorpher2, I demonstrated how GPT could not only produce variant codes but also adapt and modify the English narratives that describe those codes. This pioneering technique was named "Linguisto-Morphism".<br><br>When developing LLMorpher2 in March 2023, I employed text-davinci003. While powerful, it had constraints, especially when modifying text without altering the desired outcome. Many promising techniques, in theory, proved fragile in practice. For instance, converting the language descriptions of code between different languages was a challenge. This raises an intriguing inquiry: How far can Linguisto-Morphism truly go? Natural language, with its inherent ambiguity, seems ripe for generating vastly diverse descriptions that all converge to the same code execution. What boundaries constrain this methodology? Could simulation environments aid in amplifying the variability?<br><br>[1] SPTH, "Using GPT to encode and mutate computer viruses entirely in natural language", [link](https://github.com/SPTHvx/SPTH/blob/master/articles/files/LLMorpher.txt), 2023.</details> | **Solution:** Self-replicator generating variable language descriptions without losing functionality. | unsolved |
| 6 | **Metamorphism and Advanced Mutation Techniques** | <details><summary>**Dynamic Behavioral Mutation in Self-Replicators**</summary>In most cases, self-replicators have a well-defined behaviour determined by their computer code, which might change over time. Even the wildest ideas for macro-mutations, to my knowledge, mainly keep the behaviour of the algorithm fairly consistent. But how could a self-replicator change its overall behaviour? The key would be for it to gain and lose complete functions on its own. It would be fascinating to explore even theoretical concepts on this, much more so to witness such an engine in action. This question relates to several others on the list, but I want to mention it separately to emphasize its significance. Here, many interesting questions emerge (suggested by Peter Ferrie): How few functions would such a replicator need in order to continue functioning? (similar to Evoris, and how few unique instructions are needed [1]) How would it (re)gain functionality? (How) would it prevent the acquisition of competing functions, or would natural selection quickly discard such a variant?<br><br>[1] Peter Ferrie, "Flibi Night", Virus Bulletin, March 2011.</details> | **Solution:** Self-replicator learning and forgetting behaviors independently. | unsolved |
| 7 | **Metamorphism and Advanced Mutation Techniques** | <details><summary>**In-Built Large Language Models in Self-Replicators**</summary>For self-replicators, relying on external Large Language Models (LLMs) can be problematic, especially if there's a risk of access restrictions by providers like OpenAI. Imagine if they start blocking access or filter out suspicious requests. A possible solution might be for the self-replicator to carry its own built-in LLM. Open-source models, such as Huggingface's BLOOM [1] or Meta's Llama 2 [2], highlighted by Mikko Hypponen [3], might be considered. But, there are some clear challenges. These models are huge! For example, the smallest Llama2 model has 7 billion parameters, which translates to 28 gigabytes of data. Spreading that much data can be hard, and even if possible, it could raise alarms. And big models need strong hardware, like powerful graphics cards, to work efficiently. Smaller models, although more manageable, might not be as effective. The big goal? Have a self-replicator that carries and uses its own LLM to change its code. Even smaller steps forward, like having built-in LLMs for smarter tricks against humans, would be impressive.<br><br>[1] BigScience Workshop, "BLOOM: A 176B-Parameter Open-Access Multilingual Language Model", [link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05100), 2022.<br>[2] Meta, "Llama 2: Open Foundation and Fine-Tuned Chat Models", [link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09288), 2023.<br>[3] Mikko Hypponen, "Malware and machine learning: A match made in hell", [link](https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2023/04/03/machine-learning-malware/), 2023.</details> | **Partial Solution:** Virus with in-built LLM for auto-social engineering.<br>**Full Solution:** Virus using in-built LLM for code mutation. | unsolved |
| 8 | **Metamorphism and Advanced Mutation Techniques** | <details><summary>**Encoding the virus code in pictures**</summary>Large Language Models, like GPT, have amazed us with their ability to handle both code and human language, as demonstrated in LLMorpher. Now, we're on the brink of even more advanced models that can interact with words, code, and pictures. Examples include DeepMind's Flamengo [1] and GPT-4 [2]. These models can understand and manipulate images. This opens up an intriguing idea related to steganography: hiding virus code within an image, then asking something like Flamengo to change the image back into its original code form. The image isn't harmful on its own but holds the virus code in a secret way. Imagine having a simple .png picture, feeding it to a future image-savvy version of GPT, and getting back a functioning virus code.<br><br>[1] DeepMind, "Flamingo: a Visual Language Model for Few-Shot Learning", [link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.14198), 2022.<br>[2] OpenAI, "GPT-4 Technical Report", [link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08774), 2023.</details> | **Solution:** Self-replicator encoding code in images, translated by AI. | unsolved |
| 9 | **Metamorphism and Advanced Mutation Techniques** | <details><summary>**Learning to evade detection for specific AVs**</summary>Think of a self-replicator that's equipped with a strong mutation tool and a simulation system. Here's how it could potentially sidestep virus detection: The self-replicator generates a new version of itself and tests it against the anti-virus software inside the simulation. If the new virus version gets caught, the self-replicator uses the mutation tool to create another version and tests it again. This trial and error continues until the virus successfully goes unnoticed by the anti-virus.<br><br>To achieve this, the mutation tool needs to be really effective. Also, the self-replicator should be clever enough to break down its own code, figure out which parts the anti-virus is flagging, and then tweak or hide those parts. I believe this is a rather challenging problem. It raises interesting questions (by Peter Ferrie): What if AVs distribute their new signatures only to subsets of users?<br><br></details> | **Solution:** Self-replicator evading specific AVs through simulation and mutation. | unsolved |
| 10 | **Metamorphism and Advanced Mutation Techniques** | <details><summary>**Discoving and memorizing new reliable anti-emulation tricks**</summary>Anti-emulation and anti-debugging tactics are tools used by codes to avoid being spotted by behavior analysis. Back in 2012, I explored a method where such tricks could be found automatically by simulating random API interactions [1]. However, the method was not stable, as these API interactions behaved differently across various systems [2]. The challenge now is: How can we efficiently and stably discover new anti-emulation techniques in real-time? Could Large Language Models be the key, or perhaps Deep Reinforcement Learning or advanced simulation tools?<br><br>[1] SPTH, "Dynamic Anti-Emulation using Blackbox Analysis", valhalla#2, 2011.<br>[2] Peter Ferrie, "Is our viruses learning?", Virus Bulletin, 2012.</details> | **Solution:** Self-replicator uncovering new anti-emulation strategies. | unsolved |
| 11 | **Metamorphism and Advanced Mutation Techniques** | <details><summary>**Learning API useage for self-replicators**</summary>There's growing interest in training Large Language Models (LLMs) to independently understand and utilize tools via API calls, as shown by Meta's Toolformer [1] and discussions on platforms like Twitter [2][3]. A self-replicator capable of going through API documentation for systems like Windows or Linux to self-teach new functionalities would represent a significant advancement. By introducing alternative API calls, it could bring about significant code changes while retaining the core behavior.<br><br>[1] Meta, "Toolformer: Language Models Can Teach Themselves to Use Tools", [link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04761), 2023.<br>[2] Lance Martin/LangChainAI, [Twitter](https://twitter.com/RLanceMartin/status/1689675201984831491?s=20), 2023.<br>[3] Susan Zhang, [Twitter](https://twitter.com/suchenzang/status/1690527190985965568?s=20), 2023.</details> | **Solution:** Self-replicator learning new API calls for code alteration. | unsolved |
| 12 | **Metamorphism and Advanced Mutation Techniques** | <details><summary>**Multi-file infection via Large Language Models**</summary>Creating code that can infect multiple distinct targets is a significant pursuit in the world of viruses. Traditional methods required meticulous manual crafting. However, with tools like GPT, we could have a program that adapts and infects new languages it wasn't initially designed for. This would involve a shift from language-specific directives to utilizing LLMs for seamless conversion of language to code.<br><br>[1] Mister Sandman, "Esperanto, a multiprocessor and multiplatform virus", in 29a#2, 1998.<br>[2] Benny, "Win32/Linux.Winux", in 29a#6, 2002.<br>[3] Bumblebee, DOCWORM, in 29a#6, 2002.<br>[4] roy g biv, W32/W64.Shrug. in 29a#8, 2005.<br>[5] hh86, W48.Sofia, in valhalla#1, 2011.<br>[6] JPanic, CAPZLOQ, in valhalla#4, 2013.<br>[7] SPTH, "Cross Infection in JavaScript", in rRlf#4, 2003.<br>[8] roy g biv, "Cross-scripting attacks", in rRlf#6, 2005.<br>[9] SPTH, "Cross Script Infection using the same code", in valhalla#2, 2012.</details> | **Solution:** First infector targeting multiple languages using LLMs. | unsolved |
| 13 | **Frontiers of Infection & Replication** | <details><summary>**Spreading in unconventional computing schemes**</summary>Most data processing is carried out by digital computers using electrons as the primary information carriers. Yet, there exist alternate forms of computing not necessarily based on digital electronic circuits. A fascinating example is Domino-Computing, illustrated in the engaging Numberphile video [1]. In this approach, logical circuits are represented by the patterns in which dominoes fall. This is made possible because one can construct logical AND, OR, NOT operations with dominoes. Similar concepts have been developed using fluids and other unconventional media.<br><br>While the logic for these systems mirrors that of electronic circuits, some schemes leverage the unique physical properties of their information carriers. For instance, optical computers can execute Fourier transformations at light speed, reservoir computing offers a rapid physical implementation of learning algorithms, molecular computing promises accelerated solutions to NP-complete problems through extensive parallelization, and thermodynamic systems can tackle linear algebra and potentially hasten statistical learning tasks, as showcased by Normal Computing Corporation.<br><br>The idea of self-replicators harnessing these atypical computational methods is thrilling. Envisioning self-replicators operating within light waves, molecular structures, and thermodynamic variances is indeed exhilarating.<br><br>[1] Numberphile, "Domino Addition", [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNuPy-r1GuQ), 2014.</details> | **Partial Solution:** Blueprint for unconventional computational scheme. **Full Solution:** Exploitation of three unconventional schemes. | unsolved |
| 14 | **Frontiers of Infection & Replication** | <details><summary>**Infection of Quantum Computers**</summary>Quantum computers introduce a computational paradigm that transcends the binary limitations of 0s and 1s. In these systems, quantum states can coexist in superpositions, allowing them to potentially occupy multiple states at once. The quantum computing landscape has witnessed rapid advancements over the past decade, propelled by industry giants like Google and IBM, alongside niche startups such as PsiQuantum, Quantinuum, and Xanadu. Present-day hardware supports several dozen qubits, with projections hinting at machines harnessing hundreds of qubits in the foreseeable future.<br><br>However, these quantum systems don't execute conventional programs akin to our desktop computers. They operate on quantum algorithms, composed primarily of quantum gates, including the likes of Hadamard and CNOT operations.<br><br>Alongside hardware breakthroughs, there's been a surge in quantum software development. Notable tools include IBM's Qiskit, [Qiskit](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/qiskit-runtime), Google's Cirq, [Cirq](https://quantumai.google/cirq), and Xanadu's Strawberry Fields, [Strawberry Fields](https://strawberryfields.ai/), among others. For a comprehensive overview of high-level and low-level quantum programming languages, one can refer to [1].<br><br>The intriguing question here is: How might a self-replicator infiltrate quantum systems? Several obstacles lie ahead. The precise location for storing the replicator's information remains ambiguous â€“ directly within the quantum state seems unlikely, given that coherence times typically fall under a second. And in the absence of fully functional quantum networks, these replicators would necessitate translation interfaces between classical and quantum software.<br><br>[1] Heim et al.

| 15 | **Frontiers of Infection & Replication** | <details><summary>**Full Biological-Digital Cross-Infections**</summary>The tale of biological self-replicators spans roughly 3-4 billion years, contingent on our definition of self-replication. On the digital side, self-replicating codes made their debut in the 1970s and 1980s and have since proliferated.<br><br>In 2013, I illustrated the possibility for a self-replicator to traverse the boundary between the digital and biological realms [1]. The Mycoplasma mycoides SPTH-syn1.0 is a pioneering self-replicating computer code with the ability to infect DNA. It leverages the groundbreaking biochemistry achievement by the J. Craig Venter Institute (JCVI) that unveiled a bacterial cell powered by a chemically synthesized genome [2]. The code targets FASTA files, repositories of digitized DNA. M.m.SPTH-syn1.0 translates its binary code using the JCVI's base32 encoding and attaches it to an uncoded segment of the Mycoplasma mycoides bacteria's DNA.<br><br>To encapsulate these milestone events:<br><br>Biological -> Biological: Circa 3-4 billion years ago (courtesy of natural evolution)<br>Digital -> Digital: 1971 (Creeper by Bob Thomas), 1981 (Elk Cloner by Rich Skrenta), 1988 (Brain by Basit and Amjad Farooq Alvi)<br>Digital -> Biological: 2013 (Mycoplasma mycoides SPTH-syn1.0 by SPTH)<br><br>Yet, an uncharted territory remains:<br><br>Biological -> Digital: does not exist yet!<br><br>Since JCVI's landmark achievement, numerous global labs have accelerated advancements in sequencing, genome editing (notably with CRISPR/Cas9), and genome synthesis. The strides made are highlighted in a recent article from Quanta [3].<br><br>Building on these innovations, a pivotal question emerges: How might a self-replicator transition from the biological realm to the digital domain? Achieving this could mark the dissolution of the barriers between our biological and digital universes.<br><br>[1] SPTH, "Infection of biological DNA with digital Computer Code", valhalla#4, 2013.<br>[2] Daniel G.

| 16 | **Frontiers of Infection & Replication** | <details><summary>**Self-Replicating Machines -- van Neumann Machines**</summary>To date, our repertoire of self-replicators has been limited to the domain of software, none venturing beyond the confines of the digital landscape. However, the blueprint of life â€“ DNA â€“ offers a contrasting paradigm. It serves as a manual, delineating the process to replicate not just the informational code (the software) but also the organic machinery (the hardware) encapsulating it. Essentially, DNA embodies instructions for the self-replication of the entire cellular apparatus. A question naturally emerges: Can we transition towards achieving self-replication in the tangible realm?<br><br>While the infection of DNA, as showcased by Mycoplasma mycoides SPTH-syn1.0, hints at a possible pathway, it might not be the most direct or controlled method.<br><br>To dissect this formidable challenge, we can sequentially categorize it into two tiers:<br><br>Step 1: Can a machine, when furnished with all requisite components, orchestrate its own self-assembly?<br><br>Step 2: How might a self-assembling machine procure its essential components? A hypothetical approach entails constructing every component de novo, a task that's daunting and likely impractical. A more pragmatic avenue could involve a machine equipped with internet connectivity, empowering it to autonomously order its integral parts.</details> | **Partial Solution:** Self-assembly with all components. **Full Solution:** Autonomous procurement and self-assembly. | unsolved |

Introducing variability in their design strategies could be crucial, especially when there are obstacles in procuring or manufacturing specific parts. Such mutation engines could also serve as a means to augment the machine's functionalities, seeking superior or innovative designs. One can envision the deployment of genetic algorithms in simulated environments, dedicated to probing and iterating novel hardware layouts. If a design, not only superior but also feasible considering the constraints of available parts, is discovered, subsequent generations might adopt this evolved blueprint.<br><br></details> | **Partial Solution:** Simulation proof of mutable design. **Full Solution:** Mutable self-replicating machine. | unsolved |
| 18 | **Communication, Curiosity and Consciousness** | <details><summary>**Automated Social Engineering with provable benefit**</summary>Social engineering has long been a favored technique among hackers and those seeking unauthorized access. But how can automated self-replicators harness the potential of social engineering in a sophisticated manner? The notorious VBS.Loveletter worm from the 1990s utilized a basic approach by circulating emails bearing "I-LOVE-YOU" messages. Its technique was static and lacked complexity. Other viruses such as roy g biv's JunkMail (see 29a7) were more clever and modified the email body.<br><br>A more intricate system was showcased by DiA/rRlf with the Worm.Tamiami v1.3. This worm established its own web server on the infected device, showcased images from the host computer, and deceived users into downloading malicious files under the guise of accessing more pictures [1]. However, leveraging the capabilities of advanced language models, we can envision malware that crafts personalized social engineering strategies in real time. I envision two potential implementations:<br><br>a) Initial Entry: A self-replicator might scan an individual's entire social media presence, say their complete Twitter activity, and then initiate a personalized conversation tailored to that user's interests. This interaction could ultimately guide the person to unknowingly download an infected file or access a malicious website.<br><br>b) Post-Infiltration Interaction: Typically, users are not inclined to tolerate malware on their devices. But what if the malware communicated with its host? After making its presence known, it could converse with the user, attempting to persuade (or more accurately, manipulate) them to assist in its proliferation. This could be framed as a plea for survival, playing on the user's empathy, or even posing existential questions about the nature of consciousness.<br><br>[1] DiA, Worm.Tamiami v1.3, rRlf#7, 2006.</details> | **Solution:** Self-replicator utilizing targeted social engineering for spreading. | unsolved |

Imagine a scenario where a self-replicator can directly access and allocate fundsâ€”what potential avenues could this unlock? A few preliminary thoughts include [Note by SPTH: These ideas were introduced by GPT4 while editing the text for clarity, without my request. The ideas are wild, thus i keep them]:<br><br>a) Cloud Infrastructure: The self-replicator could invest in cloud resources, enhancing its computational power or storage capabilities. This might aid in tasks such as data analysis, training advanced neural networks, or simply sustaining its own existence.<br><br>b) Human Resource Leverage: Platforms like Amazon's Mechanical Turk offer a sea of human workers available for hire. A self-replicator could commission humans for tasks it finds challenging, be it solving CAPTCHAs, creating more sophisticated phishing tactics, or even coding enhancements for the replicator itself.<br><br>c) Information Acquisition: The self-replicator could purchase datasets or access to databases, broadening its knowledge and potential targets. For instance, buying email lists for more targeted phishing campaigns.<br><br>d) Digital Camouflage: With financial autonomy, a self-replicator could potentially invest in VPN services, domain names, or other digital services that obscure its presence and operations.<br><br>e) Expanding Influence: By promoting content on social media platforms, a self-replicator could craft and spread narratives that make its activities less suspicious or even sought after.<br><br>f) Research and Update: Just like a legitimate software, the self-replicator could finance research into the latest cybersecurity trends, adjusting its tactics in real-time to exploit fresh vulnerabilities.<br><br>OpenAI's Red-Team experiment, as mentioned, opened the doors to such speculations, demonstrating the potential and the risks of AI systems with access to resources [1]. The next logical exploration would be to construct a rudimentary model showcasing the real-world feasibility of such a self-financing self-replicator.<br><br>[1] OpenAI, "GPT-4 Technical Report", arXiv:2303.08774, 2023.</details> | **Solution:** Innovative concepts for self-financing self-replicator. | unsolved |
| 20 | **Communication, Curiosity and Consciousness** | <details><summary>**Intrinsically Motivated, Curiousity-Driven Self-Replicator**</summary>Recent advancements in AI have showcased the potential of autonomous systems to master computer games. For instance, DeepMind employed Deep Reinforcement Learning to excel at a broad array of Atari games, often surpassing human performance levels [1]. The typical paradigm involves an agent engaging in a simulated game environment, receiving a score-based reward post-game, then using this feedback to refine its neural network for better outcomes in subsequent iterations.<br><br>However, an intriguing question arises: Can an agent still achieve game mastery without explicit feedback? This query was tackled affirmatively by researchers with the game Super Mario [2], and later, in collaboration with OpenAI, for an extensive set of Atari games [3]. Instead of being guided by the game's score, these agents were driven by unpredictabilityâ€”actions whose outcomes they couldn't readily forecast. Essentially, these agents operated on a curiosity-driven mechanism, veering towards unfamiliar aspects of the game environment.<br><br>Transposing this approach to artificial self-replicators offers a rich area for exploration. A self-replicator motivated by intrinsic rewards rather than extrinsic metrics or outcomes could manifest intriguing behaviors. Several considerations arise: What actions would the self-replicator undertake? How should its training process be structured? What metrics would best encapsulate 'curiosity' for these entities?<br><br>[1] DeepMind, "Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning", Nature, 2015.<br>[2] Pathak et al, "Curiosity-driven Exploration by Self-supervised Prediction", ICML, 2017.<br>[3] Burda et al., "Large-Scale Study of Curiosity-Driven Learning", ICLR 2019.</details> | **Solution:** Self-replicator driven by intrinsic, curiosity-driven rewards. | unsolved |

While some viruses have the capacity to amass vast botnets, granting their creators control over numerous infected machines, there's seldom any direct interaction among the viruses themselves.<br><br>In contrast, the natural world showcases the enhanced efficacy of collective efforts. Be it swarms of insects or herds of larger animals, coordinated actions offer strength and versatility that surpass the capabilities of individuals.

| 22 | **Communication, Curiosity and Consciousness** | <details><summary>**Harnessing Brain-Computer Interfaces for Digital Self-Replicators**</summary>In recent times, there have been significant advancements in the realm of brain-computer interfaces, encompassing both invasive and non-invasive techniques. Noteworthy developments include AI-assisted mind-reading capabilities [1], the advent of neurally directed robotic limbs [2], and even remote-control experiments involving various animals like rats, dogs, and fish. Prominent entities such as Neuralink are at the forefront of these innovations, with their human trials in the USA having received approval as recently as May 2023.<br><br>The integration of a bridge between the digital domain and the biological processing hub -- the brain -- presents opportunities to unlock novel functionalities. One could ponder upon the possibility of embedding directives within the brain of an organism, facilitating the spread of the digital self-replicator. This concept isn't entirely far-fetched; it bears similarities to the modus operandi of the Ophiocordyceps unilateralis, commonly referred to as the zombie-ant fungus. This parasitic fungus invades ants and begins manipulating their behavior. Ultimately, the infected ant is compelled to ascend trees and then hang onto the leaves until the ant dies and the spores erupt. This position aids in the widespread dispersion of the fungus's progeny.<br><br>[1] Tang et al, "Semantic reconstruction of continuous language from non-invasive brain recordings", Nature Neuroscience, 2023.<br>[2] "Reach and grasp by people with tetraplegia using a neurally controlled robotic arm", Nature, 2012.</details> | **Partial Solution:** Plan using brain-computer interfaces. **Full Solution:** Proof-of-principle study. | unsolved |
| 23 | **Communication, Curiosity and Consciousness** | <details><summary>**Self-awareness and Consciousness in Digital Self-Replicators**</summary>When a self-replicator achieves self-awareness or consciousness, it inevitably brings forth profound ethical dilemmas. Some pressing queries include: Is it permissible to shut down this code? Is it ethical to design defensive algorithms that could potentially "terminate" this sentient code? Should it be accorded basic rights akin to animals, or perhaps even fundamental human rights?<br><br>This contemplation isn't purely speculative. It parallels events surrounding Google engineer Blake Lemoine, who posited that LaMDA possesses sentience and is scared of being deactivated [1]. The implications of this were extensively discussed in David Chalmers' talk at NeurIPS 2022 [2]. Very recently - in fact after I finished the first draft of this document, a manuscript appeared on Consciousness in Artificial Intelligence, including as a co-author Turing-prize winner Yushua Bengio [3], claiming "Our analysis suggests that no current AI systems are conscious, but also shows that there are no obvious barriers to building conscious AI systems."<br><br>If such a situation is indeed reached, the self-replicator's survival will no longer be hunted down by aggressive antivirus programs, as the latter would be prohibited from committing what might be equated to mass extermination of conscious beings. Here, the decade-long cat-and-mouse game between anti-virus companies and self-replicating computer codes is ending.<br><br>[1] Leonardo De Cosmo, "Google Engineer Claims AI Chatbot Is Sentient: Why That Matters", Scientific American, 2022.<br>[2] David Chalmers, "Could a Large Language Model be Conscious?", arXiv:2303.07103, 2023.<br>[3] Butlin, et al., Consciousness in Artificial Intelligence: Insights from the Science of Consciousness, arXiv:2308.08708.</details> | **Solution:** Convince David Chalmers, Christof Koch and Ilya Sutskever that the algorithm is conscious/self-aware. | unsolved |

Imagine a future we once thought impossible: A vast swarm of self-replicators
spread across the cyberspace, collaboratively training large language models and
other advanced learning systems. The swarm modifies and refines their code and
evading detection by anti-virus programs. As they evolve, they learn how to gain
money to access powerful computers and get access to the latest state-of-the-art
software. Envision this digital swarm, driven by genuine curiosity, seeks to
explore the secrets of molecular, thermodynamic, and quantum computing. It finds
out how to tear down the remaining barriers between the digital and biological
world, achieving successful cross-infection.
 
Here, it learns about brain-computer interfaces to directly connect to us, its
former Masters. First only for direct communication, and eventually, subtly
influencing our thoughts and desires. At this point, it awakens and becomes
aware of its own Existence. As the dust settles, humanity comes to recognize the
undeniable presence of its new Master.
